<p>I am taking this occasion to thank all of my
readers, boys and girls alike, who have been so
kind as to write to me. Sometimes your letters
have gone unanswered for a long time, I fear;
and it is possible that now and then, entirely by
accident, one has been lost sight of entirely. If
so I am both sorry and apologetic, for your letters
are always a real pleasure to me, whether, as
is so surprisingly often the case, they are filled
with praise for my stories, or, as is sometimes the
case, they call me to account for mistakes made.
Your criticisms, always just, are perhaps better
merited than your praise, and are quite as well
appreciated. My thanks and my compliments,
then, to all my correspondents for their kindly
expressions, and my thanks and compliments to
all my readers for their kind allegiance.</p>

<p class="noic">Very truly yours,</p>

<p class="cap">The Banjo and Mandolin Club, huddled together
on the right of the platform in Assembly
Hall, strummed diligently and with
enthusiasm, their zeal atoning for shortcomings
due to lack of practice. For this was the first
night of the fall term, and many members had not
touched their instruments since the final chord had
been twanged on class day. (Brewster, playing
second mandolin, was doing bravely with a silver
dime, having lost his pick and not being able to
borrow one!) Beyond the platform some two
hundred and fifty clear-eyed, clean-skinned boys
sang the words with vim. Many, unable to satisfactorily
express their enthusiasm vocally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
kept time with their feet. Across the platform
from the musicians sat the Assistant Principal,
Mr. Collins, the physical instructor, Mr. Bendix,
the head coach, Mr. Payson, the president of the
First Class, Lawrence Goodyear, and the football
captain, Dan Vinton. The mass meeting had
been called to formally open the football season
at Yardley Hall School. The song ended in a
final triumphant burst of sound and Goodyear
arose. As he moved to the front of the platform
the applause began, the stamping of feet and the
long-drawn “<em>A-a-ay!</em>” repeated over and over
until Goodyear’s upraised hand commanded quiet.</p>

<p>“We’re here to-night, fellows, to start things
going. We’re going to hear from the faculty and
from the head coach and the captain, and all I’m
supposed to do is to introduce the speakers. But
before I do that there’s just one thing I want to
say, fellows, and it’s this. We’re going to win
this year—”</p>

<p>The cheers burst forth deafeningly, and it was
a full minute before Goodyear could go on.</p>

<p>“Just as we did last year and other years before
that.” (Another demonstration, but briefer.)
“But to do it we must all get together and stand
right back of the team every minute. It’s school
loyalty that does the business. Every fellow who
has been on a team knows what it means to feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
that the school is right back of him. It means
a lot, I tell you; I don’t say that it wins games,
but it comes mighty near it sometimes. The team
may have its failures; it can’t win all the time;
but it isn’t going to help matters if you start
‘knocking.’ There may be mistakes made; that
happens now and then; but don’t ‘roast’ the team
for it. Don’t roast anyone; get behind and push
harder than ever! That’s all, fellows. Mr. Collins
will now speak a few words to you.”</p>

<p>The audience proved that it was in entire sympathy
with Goodyear’s sentiments by cheering
long and loudly. And then it began again as the
Assistant Principal stepped to the front of the
stage. Mr. Collins, in spite of the fact that he
represented Authority and meted out punishment
to ill-doers, was very popular. Doctor Hewitt,
or “Toby” as the school called him, was the
Principal, but the doctor was getting well along
in years now and the actual school management
fell on the younger and very capable shoulders
of “Mr. Warren Collins, A.M., Yale,” to quote
the school catalogue. Mr. Collins confined his
remarks to-night to a few moments only. He said
he was glad to see them all back again, glad to
see so much enthusiasm and glad that the football
prospects looked so bright. “With a settled
coaching policy well established, a coach whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
we all admire and respect and a captain who has
proved himself popular, brilliant and earnest,”
said Mr. Collins, “we are very fortunate, I think.
And I, for one, shall be very much surprised if
this season proves anything but one of the best
in recent years.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bendix had his meed of welcome and applause
when he followed the Assistant Principal.
Although “Muscles” was a hard taskmaster and
was often well hated by the lazier youths, he was
generally liked. Besides, this was the beginning
of the term, the old boys were happy at getting
back again and the newcomers delighted to be
there, and they would have cheered even
“Mother” Walker, who was the least loved of all
the faculty, had he appeared. Mr. Bendix had
quite a little to say about physical examinations
and the matter of training, and his remarks were
not especially exhilarating. But everyone heard
him through with respect and then burst into
thunderous cheers as the football captain came
to the front of the platform.</p>

<p>Dan Vinton was a First Class boy, seventeen
years of age, tall and lithe, with an alert, good-looking
face in which a pair of steady brown eyes
and a distinctly good-tempered mouth were the
most notable features. Just at present the mouth
was smiling, but there was embarrassment in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
smile, for Dan wasn’t much of a speaker and had
been dreading this occasion for weeks. As he
waited for the applause to cease he sunk his hands
in his trousers pockets, and then, realizing his
lapse, hurriedly pulled them out again. The
cheers changed to a shout of laughter and a boy
in a front seat called:</p>

<p>“Put ’em back again, Dan!”</p>

<p>Then the hall quieted down, and Dan, more embarrassed
than before, began to speak.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” he said, “I can’t talk very well. In
fact, I’m just about scared to death. I guess
you can see that. But what I’ve got to say won’t
take long. You’ve made me captain and I’m going
to do the best I know how for you. I’m not
making any promises. That would be a silly
thing to do because we none of us can tell what
may happen as—as the season advances. But
we’ve got a mighty good start for the team this
fall. We’ve got five of the fellows who played
against Broadwood last year and a lot of good
second string fellows. So as far as—as experienced
material goes we’ve got no kick coming.
But I don’t want you to think that we’ve got all
the men we want, for we haven’t. I hope that
to-morrow afternoon every one of you chaps who
hasn’t lost a leg or an arm will come out for the
team. I want to see the biggest bunch of candidates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
that ever turned out at Yardley! And
don’t stay away because you think you can’t play
football. Come out and get to work and we’ll
tell you in a week whether you can play or not.
You know they’ve changed the rules again this
year and a fellow doesn’t have to weigh two hundred
pounds to be of use to the team. We want
fellows who have speed and who can handle a
ball, and, above all, we want fellows who can kick.
Well, I guess that’s all.” Dan’s hands unconsciously
went back to his pockets and a cheer went
up. But he didn’t take them out this time. He
only smiled. “There’s one thing more, though,”
he went on earnestly. “What Goodyear told you
about standing back of the team is so. I don’t
mean just coming down to the field and cheering.
That’s all right as far as it goes. What I mean
is letting us know all the time that you’re right
back of us, hoping us on, wishing us on, pulling
every minute! You do your share, fellows, and
we’ll do ours, I promise you!”</p>

<p>Pandemonium reigned for a good two minutes
after Dan walked back to his chair. Then Hammel,
the baseball captain, was on his feet calling
for “a cheer for Captain Vinton, fellows, and
make it good!” And it was good, and if Oxford
Hall hadn’t been built of granite I think it would
have shook under that outburst.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Payson got up, and more cheering followed,
for the big, broad-shouldered man of thirty-two
who faced them was a school idol. In his
six years as football and baseball coach at Yardley,
John Payson had turned out four winning
teams on the gridiron and had done very nearly
as well on the diamond. He had quick, sharp
black eyes, a broad, strong jaw and an ease and
grace of carriage that quite belied his two hundred
and odd pounds. Payson spoke quietly and
seriously and the hall was so still that you might
have heard a pin drop. He agreed with the previous
speakers that the outlook was bright, but
reminded them that many a team with fine early
season prospects had come a cropper before now.
And then he repeated the captain’s call for candidates,
for hard work, for self-sacrifice and devotion
and for the whole-souled support of the
student body. And then, as he turned away and
the stilled audience burst into sound, the leader of
the Banjo and Mandolin Club nodded his head
and the strains of “The Years Roll On” broke
into the tumult. Instantly every fellow was on
his feet, singing the slow, sweet song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The years roll on. Too soon we find<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Our boyhood days are o’er.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The scenes we’ve known, the friends we’ve loved,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Are gone to come no more.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
<span class="i1">But in the shrine of Memory<br /></span>
<span class="i3">We’ll hold and cherish still<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The recollection fond of those<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Dear days on Yardley Hill.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Very reverently they sang it, and not many
without a thrill and, perhaps, a moistening of the
eyes. Many of the older boys could remember
standing with heads bared to the cold November
wind and singing it grandly after Yardley had
gone down to defeat before her rival. All save
the new boys had sung it at class day under
swaying, many-hued lanterns and with the warm
breath of June in their faces. If you are a Yardley
man, young or old, you can never hear that
song unmoved:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The years roll on. To man’s estate<br /></span>
<span class="i3">From youthful mold we pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And Life’s stern duties bind us round,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">But God will guard through storms and give<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The strength to do His will<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And treasure e’er the lessons learned<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Of old on Yardley Hill.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The last strain died away, there was a moment
of silence, and then caps were slipped onto heads,
feet shuffled on the floor, settees were pushed aside
and the fellows crowded toward the doors. Then
down the old, worn stairway they went, talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and laughing a little subduedly, and out into a
mild September night lighted by millions of twinkling
white stars that seemed to shine down kindly
as though sympathizing with the glow of exaltation,
of courage and kindliness and patriotism, in
all those boyish hearts.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>TOWNE PLAYS A JOKE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">To one at least of the audience the mass meeting
had been an event of momentous interest.
Kendall Burtis, squeezed into a seat in the
very last row of settees, had followed the course
of events with rapt attention. To Kendall it was
wonderful, even miraculous, for of all the sixty-odd
boys who had entered Yardley Hall School
that day none, I think, was as proud and happy
as he. Kendall was a boy whose dream had come
true.</p>

<p>There had been a time, only four years ago,
when Kendall’s ambition, so far as schooling was
concerned, extended no further than graduation
at the Roanoke High School. Even that had
seemed a good deal to hope for, for Kendall’s
folks were not very well off and there were times
in the spring and fall when his services on the
farm were badly needed and when tramping into
Roanoke to school savored of desertion. Had it
not been for his mother Kendall would have
missed far more school than he did. Mrs. Burtis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
wanted him to have what she called “a real education,”
and many a time Kendall would have
remained at home to drop potatoes or swing along
behind a cultivator had she not interfered. Then
had come a year when all through the Aroostook
Country of Maine the potato crop had been an
almost total failure. That failure had spelled
ruin to more than one grower, and while Farmer
Burtis had been in shape to weather the storm,
it had proved a hard blow to him financially, and
when Mrs. Burtis, casting about for some way
in which to add to the slender account at the Roanoke
Bank, had suggested taking summer boarders,
Kendall’s father had, after a good deal of hesitation,
acquiesced. The result was a small advertisement
in a Boston paper, an advertisement
that bore fruit in the shape of four healthy, hungry,
brown-skinned college boys. That had been
a wonderful summer for Kendall. He had been
only “going on twelve” then, but he was large for
his age, and old, too, and the collegians had made
a good deal of him and he had had the best time
of his life. He had acted as guide on fishing and
tramping excursions, had driven them to and from
Roanoke, two miles away, and had listened in
wondering and delighted awe to their happy-go-lucky
talk and banter.</p>

<p>“Where are you going to school, kid?” they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
had asked him one day. And Kendall had told
them that he hoped to finish at the high school
if he wasn’t wanted too badly on the farm.</p>

<p>“High school!” they had scoffed. “That will
never do! Go to a boarding school, Kid; that’s
what you want to do.”</p>

<p>But when it came to a question of which boarding
school, they couldn’t agree. Two of them said
Yardley Hall and two of them said Hillton. But
when it came to college they were quite agreed.
There was nothing to it but Yale.</p>

<p>“No matter where you go to school,” declared
the biggest one, whose name was Dana, “come to
Yale. There may be more than one prep school,
kid, but there’s only one college, and Yale’s it!”</p>

<p>“I—I thought there was Dartmouth and Harvard,”
Kendall had replied hesitatingly, and Dana
had knitted his brows and shaken his head.
“Never heard of ’em,” he had answered. And
his three companions had agreed, chuckling. Finally
Kendall had guessed that they were having
fun with him, something they were in the habit
of having. But before they had left Dana had
spoken quite seriously to Kendall.</p>

<p>“Kid,” he had said, “you work for a prep school
and college. Make your folks send you to Yardley
and then to Yale. It isn’t altogether what
you learn out of books; it’s the friends you make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and the self-reliance you get. When the time
comes you let me know; just tell me you’re ready
for Yardley and I’ll help you along. You’re a
bright kid, and nobody’s fool, and you’re the sort
of fellow Yardley wants.”</p>

<p>They were all of them, it seemed, on the football
team, and all in strict summer training. The
amount of eggs and steak and milk that they devoured
during the eight weeks of their stay was
something amazing. Every afternoon they produced
two oval, brown leather balls and went
through remarkable proceedings in the meadow
behind the barn. Strange as it may seem, Kendall
had never seen a football before, although
he had indistinct recollections of having heard or
read somewhere of the game. He looked on absorbedly
and was as proud as a peacock when,
one day, he was allowed to kick one of the illusive
objects. They got a good deal of fun out of his
attempts at first, but it wasn’t long before he had
discovered the knack, and they professed themselves
impressed with his ability.</p>

<p>“The kid’s cut out for a kicker,” declared Dana.
“Those long legs of his were just made for football.
Kid, you keep it up, do you hear? Some
day you’ll be a crackerjack kicker if you do.”</p>

<p>The four took their departure early in September
to join the rest of the football squad at New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Haven. But when they went they left one of the
battered balls behind, and during a month of
loneliness Kendall made a friend of it. Day after
day he went down to the old place in the meadow
and kicked and chased the shabby pigskin oval,
and dreamed of a time when he should be a Yardley
Hall man and play on the football team! But
the four left behind them something even better
than the old football, and that was a seed that
grew and ripened and ultimately bore fruit. They
had talked with Kendall’s father and mother, the
latter especially since she had proved the more
receptive, about the boy’s future schooling, and
Mrs. Burtis had hearkened willingly and remembered.
And in the course of time she had won
her husband to the plan of sending Kendall away
to a good preparatory school when the time came,
and, later, to college. But when the time did
come money was lacking, and at fourteen, instead
of going to Yardley Hall, Kendall went to the
high school in Roanoke. Then came a bumper
year for the Maine potato growers, and, with it—wonder
of wonders!—a shortage over the rest of
the country and correspondingly high prices. Potatoes
reached a dollar and four cents a bushel
that winter and Farmer Burtis fared well. And
Kendall’s best Christmas present was the promise
that the following September he should, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
he could pass the examinations, enter Yardley!</p>

<p>Pass the examinations indeed! Kendall never
had a doubt of it. That only meant study, and
he would have studied twenty hours a day if necessary!
It wasn’t necessary. He had passed the
Third Class examinations with flying colors. And
now, behold him a Yardlian, a boy whose dream
had come true!</p>

<p>He had listened to the speeches and watched
the proceedings with eager curiosity. And when
they had sung “The Years Roll On” he had stood
up with the others and had tried, very softly, to
follow the tune, while, somewhere inside of him,
something was stirring that was neither pleasure
nor pain, but seemed made of each. After the
meeting was over he followed the others out of
the building and, since he knew no one yet, set
off alone along the walk to his room in Clarke
Hall. He was one of the last out of Oxford, and
by the time he had reached the first entrance of
Whitson, which stands between Oxford and
Clarke, most of the gathering had disappeared.
In front of him, however, three boys were walking
and as they passed a lighted window Kendall
recognized one of them as the football captain.
As the trio occupied the width of the path and
as Kendall didn’t like to crowd past them, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
obliged to suit his pace to theirs, and so couldn’t
help hearing their conversation.</p>

<p>“How do you like your new room, Tom?” asked
Dan Vinton.</p>

<p>“Fine,” was the answer from the larger of the
other two boys.</p>

<p>“It seems funny, though, not to see Alf and
Tom,” continued the first speaker. “We’re going
to miss them, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>“Awfully,” agreed the third boy. “I’m so
used to dropping in at Number 7, Tom, that you
mustn’t be surprised if it takes me a while to
get over the habit.”</p>

<p>“Don’t get over it,” responded Tom Roeder
heartily. “Make yourself at home. I suppose
Loring and Dyer are feeling pretty big about
now.”</p>

<p>“Well, Yale got two mighty fine chaps when she
got those fellows,” said Dan Vinton. “Alf’s one
of the best there is; and so is Tom.”</p>

<p>They turned into Clarke Hall and climbed the
stairs, Tom Roeder consenting to “come on up
and chin awhile.”</p>

<p>“I ought not to, though,” he declared. “Wallace
is waiting for me to help him hang pictures.
I’ll get a hard look when I get back.”</p>

<p>“How is he?” asked Dan. “Has he taken care
of himself this summer?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Looks pretty fit. Maybe a few pounds heavy,
but it won’t take him long to drop that. He’s
just back from a cruise in his brother’s boat, and
you can’t help getting fat lying around on deck.
You don’t seem to have put on much fat, Gerald.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t,” was the reply. “I’ve been playing
tennis most all summer, and doing a little
running.”</p>

<p>“He’s grown like the dickens, though,” said
Dan. “Look at his shoulders. Remember him
when he first came, Tom? Doesn’t look now much
like he did then, eh? Oh, we’ll make a man of
you yet, Gerald!”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” laughed Gerald Pennimore.
“That’s very kind of you.”</p>

<p>The three turned to the left at the head of the
stairs and Kendall, pushing open the door of Number
24, saw them enter the corner room at the
front of the building. Kendall’s own room, which
he shared with a classmate named Harold Towne,
was Number 21, and was on the rear of the building,
its two windows looking out past the back
of Dudley to the edge of the grove. Towne was
in the room when Kendall entered. He was arranging
a row of books on the study table which,
placed in the center of the room, equidistant between
the two single beds, was common property.</p>

<p>“I’ve taken this side of the room,” announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Towne. “I knew you wouldn’t care. Anyhow,
as I was here first I had a right to change, you
know.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Kendall. “I don’t care which
side I have. I suppose there isn’t much difference.”</p>

<p>“No. Only I was on that side last year and I
thought I’d like a change,” replied the other.
“Did you bring anything to fix up with, Burtis?”</p>

<p>“N-no, I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>Towne frowned and looked about the walls.
“We’ll have to get some pictures, I guess. Cooke,
who roomed with me last year, had a lot of stuff,
but of course he took it off with him.”</p>

<p>“Did he graduate?” asked Kendall.</p>

<p>“No, he’s moved into Whitson. A chap named
Guild wanted him to room with him. Cooke
didn’t want to do it much, I guess, but Guild insisted.
We’d ought to have about three good
pictures over there around the windows. I’d
have thought you’d have brought something along
with you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t think of it,” answered Kendall.
“Besides, I don’t believe I had anything to
bring.”</p>

<p>“You live in the country, don’t you?” asked
Towne.</p>

<p>“Yes, near Roanoke. It isn’t exactly country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
though. I mean there’s a good many houses out
our way. We’re only two miles from town.”</p>

<p>Towne laughed. “Two miles! That sounds
like country to me, all right. What do you call
country, Burtis? I suppose Roanoke is just a village,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“N-no, not exactly. It’s got twenty-seven hundred
inhabitants.”</p>

<p>“Think of that! A regular metropolis, isn’t
it? Ever been to Bangor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, once; just for a day. It’s a nice city,
I think.”</p>

<p>“You bet it is. That’s where I live. Know
where the high school is?”</p>

<p>“N-no, I don’t think so. I wasn’t there long,
you see. Why?”</p>

<p>“I was going to tell you where I live. Our
house is pretty nearly as big as this whole building.”</p>

<p>“Gosh, it must take a lot to heat it!” exclaimed
Kendall.</p>

<p>“It’s heated with hot water,” said Towne.</p>

<p>“Like this is?”</p>

<p>“No, this is steam here. Hot water’s better.
I guess you haven’t been around much, have
you?”</p>

<p>“Around the country you mean? No, I haven’t.
Have you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“Er—some. I’m going to California and down
through Old Mexico some day soon. That’s a
trip for you!”</p>

<p>“Quite, some ways,” agreed Kendall. “This
is as far as I’ve been yet. It doesn’t seem much
different from Maine, either. You’d think, being
as it’s so much farther south, that it would be
sort of—of different.”</p>

<p>“You talk as though Connecticut was down
south,” laughed Towne. “It gets just as cold
here in winter as it does up home. I suppose they
put you in here with me because we’re both from
Maine.”</p>

<p>“I guess so. And we’re in the same class, too.
Maybe that had something to do with it. Those
books all yours?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve got twenty times that many at
home.”</p>

<p>“Honest?” exclaimed Kendall. “Gosh, you
must have a regular library. I’m awfully fond
of books, but I haven’t got many.”</p>

<p>“What kind of books do you like?” asked
Towne.</p>

<p>“Any kind; just books,” replied Kendall
simply.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s one kind I haven’t any love for,
and that’s text-books,” said Towne, frowning at
the array before him. “You could have a mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
good time here at Yardley if you didn’t have to
study so blamed hard.”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, but of course a fellow expects to have
to study,” answered Kendall. “I don’t mind that.
I guess I sort of like it. Still, I want to have
time enough to play football.”</p>

<p>“Say, are you one of those athletic cranks?”
demanded Towne distastefully.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so. I don’t know anything
about athletics. I’d like to play football, though.
Do you play?”</p>

<p>“Me? Well, I guess not! You don’t catch me
wearing my young life away doing those stunts.
A good game of tennis now and then is all right,
but this thing of working like a slave for a couple
of hours every afternoon and getting your bones
cracked isn’t my way, let me tell you! I don’t
mind seeing a good game sometimes, but I’m no
martyr. Besides, if you make the team you have
to go to training table and be just about half
starved. Not for mine, thank you!”</p>

<p>“That so? I guess I could stand it if they’d
let me play. What do you do to get on the team?
Just go to the captain and tell him you want to
play?”</p>

<p>Towne grinned delightedly at the new boy’s simplicity
for an instant, and then, banishing his
smile quickly, nodded. “Yes,” he replied carelessly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
“just see the captain and tell him. And,
by the way, it’s a good plan to see him pretty
soon; so many fellows want places, you know; they
might be all gone by the time you get there.
See?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thank you. I guess I’d better find him
the first thing in the morning. I wasn’t sure
whether that was the way you did it. At the meeting
to-night they said something about reporting
on the field, and I thought maybe—”</p>

<p>“What’s the good of waiting until morning?”
asked Towne, hiding his pleasure under a grave
face. “Vinton rooms just down the corridor;
Number 28; why don’t you run down there now
and put in your application?”</p>

<p>“Would it be all right?” asked Kendall
doubtfully. “I don’t want to seem fresh, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Of course it’s all right! Didn’t you hear them
saying to-night that they wanted all the fellows
they could get? Ever played the game?”</p>

<p>“No, not yet. Maybe he won’t want me.”</p>

<p>“Never fear! It’s new—er—new material
they’re always looking for. Take my advice, Burtis,
and get in your application early. Have you
got a blank?”</p>

<p>“A blank? What kind of a blank?”</p>

<p>“Why, an application blank, of course; to write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
down your name and age and so on, and what position
on the team you’d like to have.”</p>

<p>“No, could I get one to-night?”</p>

<p>Towne looked doubtful, and finally shook his
head. “Not to-night, I’m afraid. Unless—unless
Vinton has one he’ll let you have. You could ask
him, you know. And anyhow it won’t matter, I
guess. The main thing is to let him know as soon
as possible. You could fill out your blank to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I could do that,” responded Kendall
eagerly. “You don’t think he’d mind my seeing
him now, as late as this?”</p>

<p>“Late! Why, it’s only a little after nine. That
isn’t late. Don’t you worry about his minding,
Burtis; he will be tickled to find another fellow
for the team. You see there’s a good deal of difficulty
here in getting candidates enough. I daresay
he will sleep better for knowing that you’re
going to help him out.”</p>

<p>Kendall looked at Towne a bit doubtfully, but
the latter’s countenance was so innocent that his
misgivings passed and he pulled his jacket down
and smoothed his hair.</p>

<p>“I—I guess I will, then,” he murmured.
“What did you say his name was? Winton?”</p>

<p>“No, Vinton; most of the fellows call him Dan,
but you can do as you like about that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gosh, I couldn’t do that!” exclaimed Kendall.</p>

<p>“All right. Twenty-eight’s the number. Down
the hall to the right; last room on the other side.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Kendall, giving a last tug at
his sleeves. “I hope he won’t think I’m—fresh.”</p>

<p>“Never fear, old chap; he will be tickled to
death,” Towne assured him gravely. But after
the door had closed and Kendall’s footsteps died
away along the hall Towne’s gravity left him, and
he threw himself on the bed, buried his face
against the pillow and laughed until his sides
ached.</p>

<small>KENDALL MAKES A CALL</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Tom Roeder had taken himself away to
Dudley, pretending alarm at the reception
awaiting him at the hands of Wallace Hammel,
his roommate, and the two occupants of
Number 28 were left alone. Dan Vinton, having
discarded coat and vest, stretched himself on his
bed, pillowed his head on his clasped hands and
smiled across at his chum. Dan was seventeen
years old, and a trifle large for his age. Long of
limb, tall, lithe, with a sun-browned skin and not
a flabby muscle in his whole body, he looked, as
he lay there, just what he was; a healthy, wide-awake
American boy, kind-hearted, good-tempered,
honest and fearless, a born leader of his
fellows. He had steady brown eyes, a straight
nose that was a little too short for beauty, brown
hair and a good mouth. He was a member of the
First Class and captain of the Football Team, an
honor well deserved.</p>

<p>The boy who smiled back at him from the depths
of the Morris chair was a year beneath him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
age and class. Gerald Pennimore was a vivid contrast
to his roommate in physical appearance.
Several inches shorter than Dan, he lacked the
latter’s even development of body. Rather slender,
with hair that was almost yellow, the bluest
of blue eyes and a skin much too fair to take
kindly to sunburn, he looked, in contrast to Dan,
almost delicate. But his appearance belied him
to some extent, for Gerald had proved himself
a good distance runner, and while it was not
likely that he would ever grow into the rugged
sort, it was probable that a year or two would
find him a very well set-up youth. He was a
good-looking youngster, with an eager, alert
face that was irresistibly attractive when it
smiled.</p>

<p>Gerald’s home was right here in Wissining, only
a short distance from the school, but since his
father, whom rumor credited with being a millionaire
several times over, was more often away
from his home than in it, Gerald had lived here
in Number 28 Clarke during his two years at
Yardley. There was, too, a town house in New
York, but save at the Christmas recesses Gerald
had seen little of that of late; while Gerald’s
father when in this part of the world was far
more likely to open up Sound View for a week
or so than occupy the Fifth Avenue residence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Gerald had found at first that being the son of
the Steamship King, as Mr. Pennimore was called,
was something of a handicap. There had been
those who called Gerald a “money-snob,” and for
the first month or two he had had a rather hard
time. But that sort of thing was long since over
now, for Gerald had proved that one can be at the
same time a gentleman and the heir to millions.
Gerald’s mother was dead and he had neither
brothers nor sisters, and under those circumstances
it was almost a miracle that he hadn’t
been utterly spoiled. Dan firmly believed that
only coming to Yardley Hall had saved him from
that fate.</p>

<p>“Back again in the old diggings,” murmured
Dan, stretching himself luxuriously on the bed.
“And for the last year,” he added with a note
of wonder in his voice. “I can hardly believe
that, Gerald. Seems now as though I’d always
be here; at least, for years and years yet. I wonder
how Alf and Tom feel. I’ll bet they miss this
place. I suppose we’ll get a line from them some
day soon.”</p>

<p>“They said they’d come over and see us,” answered
Gerald.</p>

<p>“I know.” Dan nodded wisely. “But I guess
they’ll be too busy to do that for awhile. I hope
Alf makes the freshman team.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, he will make it all right. I wouldn’t wonder
if he got the captaincy.”</p>

<p>“Maybe. I don’t envy him it, though. Gerald,
sometimes I feel as though I’d give a hundred
dollars—if I had it—to wake up and find I wasn’t
captain after all! I get scared stiff whenever I
stop and think what’s ahead of me the next two
months. Just suppose we get beaten!”</p>

<p>“Suppose we do. It’s happened before, hasn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Not when I was captain! That’s where the
trouble is. When you’re captain and responsible
for the success of the team it’s a lot different, I
tell you, Gerald. Why, if Broadwood beats us this
fall I’ll feel like tying a dumb-bell to each foot
and jumping into the Sound!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be an idiot, Dan! You can’t do any
more than your best. If we get beaten after that
it won’t be any more your fault than—than mine.
You get that notion out of your head or I’ll have
to put you in a sanitarium before the season’s
over.”</p>

<p>“And maybe I’d be mighty glad to go,” sighed
Dan.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what you’re so pessimistic about,”
said Gerald. “We’ve got a good start for a new
team, and all that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“I know, but—well, I’ll tell you, chum. We’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
won from Broadwood two years running, and I’ve
got an idea that the other fellow is about due
for a victory. We never have won three times
in succession, and it doesn’t seem likely that we
will now. I wish we’d lost last year’s game, or
the one before that. It’s fighting against the Law
of Averages, whatever that may be!”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! We said the same thing last year, I
remember. Yardley had won the year before and
so it was Broadwood’s turn. Maybe it was, but
Broadwood missed her turn. She will miss it
again. Why, look here, Dan, there isn’t any good
reason why we shouldn’t win every year for the
next century!”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, there’s no use worrying about it
now, I suppose. As you say, Mr. Pennimore, a
fellow can only do his best. I’ll do my best and
the Law of Averages can take care of itself. I
hope, though, there will be a nice big bunch of
candidates on the field to-morrow. You know,
Gerald, I’ve always believed that many a good
football player has been lost for lack of a chance
to show his hand. I’ll give every fellow a fair
try-out. And if any of the last year men think
that they’re certain of their places they’re fooled.
For they’re not. Everyone of them has got to
work hard or go to the bench.”</p>

<p>“I’m coming out, you know, Dan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, chum, but don’t hope too much.
You’re pretty light for the Varsity. It won’t do
you any harm to try, though.”</p>

<p>“You’re not very encouraging,” Gerald
laughed. “You might at least pretend to think
I have a chance, Dan. And, after all, I guess there
have been lighter fellows on the team before this.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t thinking so much of your actual
weight,” replied Dan. “A lot depends on the
way a chap uses his weight. I may be all wrong,
chum, and I hope I am, but it just doesn’t seem
to me that you’re a ‘football man.’ But I want
you to come out and try, just the same. Perhaps
you can make the Second Team.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you! No Second for me; First
Team or none.”</p>

<p>“You’re a modest little blossom,” laughed Dan.
“But, I say, what about your cross-country
work?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right. I spoke to Goodyear
about it, and he said Payson would let me off
football practice now and then. Besides, they’ve
got a dandy lot of cross-country fellows this year
and don’t need me very much.”</p>

<p>“I think you’re making a mistake, chum.
You’re a first-rate distance runner, with a chance
of finishing first or second in the cross-country
run, and you want to sacrifice your real talent for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
a bare chance of making good in football. That’s
silly, Gerald.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t, Dan. I’ve always wanted to play
football; you know that; and now Muscles has
given me permission to play for the first time.
And I’m going to have a whack at it. Besides,
I don’t see why trying for the Football Team
won’t keep me in condition for cross-country
work.”</p>

<p>“You don’t? Well, I do. And look here; suppose
you should make the team, and suppose you
were wanted to play against Broadwood. What
would you do in that case? Run a four mile cross-country
race in the morning and then play in a
gruelling football game in the afternoon?”</p>

<p>Gerald’s face fell, but he answered stoutly: “I
don’t see why not.”</p>

<p>“You don’t?” Dan laughed. “You would,
though, before the game was very old. Besides,
Gerald, you know very well that Muscles won’t
let you go in for both.”</p>

<p>“He told me I might.”</p>

<p>“Cross-country and football both?”</p>

<p>“He told me I might play football, and he
knows very well that I’m on the Cross-Country
Team.”</p>

<p>“He may know it, but he’s forgotten it. And
it won’t take him long to remember it, Gerald.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Anyhow, it’s a sure thing that he isn’t going to
let you do both.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll give up cross-country work,” said
Gerald.</p>

<p>Dan shook his head smilingly. “I don’t believe
it. It wouldn’t be fair to the school, Gerald. A
fellow’s got to do what he can do best; that’s
a duty. Suppose I gave up baseball in the spring
and said I wanted to try for the Tennis Team!”</p>

<p>Gerald had to smile at that. “The Tennis Team
would beg you to keep on with baseball, Dan!”</p>

<p>“Probably, but the idea’s the same. I wouldn’t
have any right to cut out baseball just because
I wanted to do something else more. And you
haven’t any right to give up cross-country running,
Gerald.”</p>

<p>“Then I can’t play football after all?” questioned
Gerald disconsolately.</p>

<p>“Not if you’re going to do the square thing.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Gerald mutinously,
“but it seems to me that a fellow has some right
to do what he likes best.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. The question is, though, how much
right? You know,” continued Dan with a twinkle
in his eye, “we have a motto here at Yardley,
Gerald. I wonder if you’ve ever heard it.”</p>

<p>“What?” Gerald demanded suspiciously.</p>

<p>“‘The School first,’” replied Dan quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Gerald’s eyes fell and he was silent a moment.
Then, “Just the same,” he muttered, “it’s hard
lines after wanting to play so long. And I won’t
be able to play baseball in the spring because I’ll
have to train with the Track Team!”</p>

<p>“You’re too ambitious,” laughed Dan. “Why
not be satisfied with the glory you have? You’re
a good cross-country runner, you’ve won your
letter in hockey and track; isn’t that enough?”</p>

<p>“But I’m not thinking of glory,” argued Gerald.
“I want to play football because I like it.”</p>

<p>“Then join your class team.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t—isn’t the same thing.”</p>

<p>“Why not? It’s football. And you say you
don’t want the glory.”</p>

<p>“I don’t, but—”</p>

<p>Gerald’s explanation was cut short by a knock
on the door. He frowned at the interruption,
glanced inquiringly at Dan and cried “Come in!”
The order was obeyed and a boy of about Gerald’s
own age, but taller, larger and sturdier, entered
and stood embarrassedly in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Is—is Mr. Vinton in?” he asked.</p>

<p>Dan sat up on the bed and nodded, looking inquiringly
at the visitor. The latter wasn’t by any
means a handsome youth. His hair was of a
nondescript shade of light brown, a sort of ashy-brown,
his eyes were gray, his nose just escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
being a pug nose and his mouth was decidedly
large. But there was something about the face,
which was most liberally sprinkled with brown
freckles, that made you like it; perhaps the eyes
with their straightforward way of looking at you,
perhaps the nose with its humorous disregard for
classic outline, perhaps the good-natured mouth
that seemed always on the point of breaking into
a smile, perhaps the combination of all the features
together. But whatever the cause, the
result was undeniable; the face was pleasing in
spite, or perhaps because, of its homeliness.</p>

<p>The boy came from the country; there was no
manner of doubt about that. His hair, worn too
long according to city standards, told you so;
the freckles told you so; the poorly cut, pepper-and-salt
suit of clothes fairly cried it at you. And
a certain awkwardness of carriage affirmed it.
Seeing the boy’s embarrassment, Dan went to his
rescue.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he said. “Come in and sit down.
I’m Vinton. What can I do for you?”</p>

<p>“Why—why—my name’s Burtis,” stammered
the other. “I just got here to-day, and I was at
the meeting to-night and heard you say you
wanted fellows to play football, and I thought I’d
come and see if you had an application blank
you—you don’t want.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“A—a what?” asked Dan politely.</p>

<p>“An application blank; to fill out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, an application blank,” responded Dan,
trying to disguise his puzzlement. “I see. Now
what kind of an application blank? What is
it you want to apply for?”</p>

<p>“Why, I—I want to play football,” explained
Kendall.</p>

<p>“I’ve got you now,” said Dan gravely, fearing
to glance at Gerald, who had turned his face
away from the boy at the door. “Sit down, won’t
you?”</p>

<p>Kendall closed the door behind him carefully
and took the nearest chair. “I don’t know as you
want any more players?” he observed questioningly.</p>

<p>“We surely do,” replied Dan heartily. “We
want all the players we can get. By the way, let
me introduce you to my roommate, Mr. Pennimore.”</p>

<p>“Glad to meet you,” said Gerald after a supreme
struggle with his voice. “We—er—we
were talking football when you came.”</p>

<p>“You’ve played before?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>Kendall shook his head. “No, sir, but I thought
I’d like to learn how.”</p>

<p>“Of course. Well, you come out to the field
to-morrow afternoon at four o’clock and report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to Mr. Payson. He’s our coach. Have you any
togs?”</p>

<p>“Togs?”</p>

<p>“Yes, football clothes; canvas pants and jacket,
you know; and shoes.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, but I guess I can get some if they
don’t cost too much.”</p>

<p>“Well, they aren’t very expensive. Still, if I
were you, I’d just put on an old suit of everyday
things to-morrow. Maybe you won’t like the
game after you’ve tried it. In that case you’ll
have saved yourself the price of your football
togs.”</p>

<p>“I guess that would be best, but I’m pretty sure
I’ll like football. That’s why I came to see you
to-night. I was afraid if I waited until morning
all the places might be taken.”</p>

<p>Gerald had a bad attack of coughing just then,
and Dan became very busy looking for something
on the table which he didn’t find.</p>

<p>“Oh, no fear of that,” he replied finally. “You
see, Curtis—”</p>

<p>“My name’s Burtis,” corrected Kendall
gravely.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Burtis. You see, we award
places on the team by competition. That is, we
give every fellow a chance to show what he can
do and then we take the best of them for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
team. Every fellow who wants to can come out
and try. Of course, you’ll understand that those
who have played the game before have rather the
better chance of being retained.”</p>

<p>“I see.” Kendall nodded thoughtfully. “Maybe
I won’t be good enough, then.”</p>

<p>“You can’t tell,” said Dan kindly. “I’ve
known inexperienced fellows to make good the
first year. Some fellows are natural-born football
players.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Kendall agreed. “I guess that’s the
way with me.” He was recalling Mr. Dana’s
prophecy. “Anyway, I’d like to try it, and I’ll
be on hand surely. And I’m much obliged to
you.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. And come around again in a day
or two and let me know how you’re getting on,
will you?”</p>

<p>“Thanks. And the—the application blank.
Where could I find one to-morrow? And what
do I do with it when it’s filled out?”</p>

<p>There was a brief silence in the room. Then
Dan said gently:</p>

<p>“I guess someone has been having a joke on
you. We don’t have application blanks to fill out.
If you want to try for the team you just come out
and report on the field.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Kendall flushed. “He said—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who told you that?” asked Gerald sharply.</p>

<p>“Why, the fellow I room with. His name is
Towne.”</p>

<p>Dan looked inquiringly at Gerald. “Know
him?” he asked.</p>

<p>Gerald nodded. “Yes; Harold Towne;
‘Whitey,’ they call him. He rooms down the
hall. You know him by sight, Dan; thin, light-haired,
pasty-faced chap.”</p>

<p>Dan remembered him. “Oh, yes, I’ve seen
him,” he said. “So he told you to come to me
and ask for an application blank?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he said I must fill out a blank and
put down my name and age and what position
on the team I wanted to play. He said I’d
better do it right away or I might be too late.
That’s why I came to-night. I’m sorry. I didn’t
know.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! that’s all right. No harm done. I’m
glad you came, and I hope you’ll get on finely,
Burtis. Come and see me again and tell me about
it. Good night.”</p>

<p>“Good night,” replied Kendall. Then he fixed
his straight level eyes on Gerald. “Good night,”
he repeated.</p>

<p>“Good night,” responded Gerald gravely.</p>

<p>The door closed behind the visitor. Dan smiled
at Gerald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“His friend Towne is a bit of a joker,” he
observed.</p>

<p>“He ought to have his head punched,” declared
Gerald hotly. “Playing a joke on a chap as green
as that fellow is like—like stealing pennies from
a blind man!”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t seem to have much doubt as to
his ability to play football,” said Dan with a
laugh. “Said he guessed he was a natural-born
player.”</p>

<p>Gerald grinned. “Yes, that was funny. Still,
I like the chap’s looks just the same. And who
knows, Dan? He may turn out a star!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it will take some turning, though,”
laughed Dan. “However, he’s got my best wishes.
Goodness knows I can use all the stars I can find
this year!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Kendall returned to his room Harold
Towne was ready for bed. He faced Kendall with
one foot between the sheets and a broad grin on
his thin face.</p>

<p>“Well, did you fill out your blank?” he asked
with a chuckle. But the chuckle died away in his
throat, for Kendall advanced across the room with
an unsmiling countenance.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a good mind,” he said in a low voice,
“to punch you in the face.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Harold drew back and threw up one arm.
“Can’t you take a joke?” he stammered.</p>

<p>“Oh, that was a joke, was it?” growled Kendall.
“I call it a dirty lie. And I’d like to lick
you for it,” he added longingly. Harold backed
off toward the window, alarm written large on
his white face.</p>

<p>“You—you’d better not!” he cried.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to,” said Kendall, turning
away. “But don’t you ever get fresh with me
again, Towne, or I’ll just naturally whale you!
I’m sorry, but I don’t guess I’m going to like
you.”</p>

<p class="cap">The next day Kendall’s school life really
began. At half-past seven there was chapel,
at eight breakfast in the big dining-room, or
commons as it was called, on the first floor of
Whitson, and at nine came his first recitation,
Latin 3. At half-past nine there was French 3a.
Then came a half hour of freedom from class
rooms, a half hour put to good use in polishing up
for the next trial, mathematics 3, at half-past ten.
The mathematics instructor was Mr. McIntyre, a
hard taskmaster. At eleven-thirty there was
Physical Culture in the gymnasium. After that
came dinner at one o’clock, and, at two, English
3b. That, so far as lessons were concerned, finished
his day. At a little after three-thirty observe
him making his way toward the athletic
field, <a href="#i_fp042">an odd-looking figure</a> with his long legs <a href="#i_fp042">in
a pair of old gray trousers</a>, a faded brown sweater
completing his costume. He wore no cap and,
since his sweater was of the “turtle-neck” variety,
his hair had been much disarranged in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
struggle with it. For shoes he had put on a pair
of rubber-soled “sneakers.” As he passed along
in front of the dormitories—taking the longest
way since he had only a very general idea where
the athletic field lay—he occasioned not a little
interest in beholders. Luckily he was quite unaware
of the strangeness of his attire and so had
no ear for the frequent chuckles that followed his
progress.</p>

<p>The curving path took him past the fronts of
Whitson and Oxford and Merle. Below him The
Prospect fell away to the green meadows and a
half a mile away was the little railroad station
of Wissining where he had left the train two days
before. Beyond the station lay, a blue ribbon in
the afternoon sunlight, the Wissining River, with
the town of Greenburg beginning at its further
bank. Behind him, over the tops of the trees, lay
Long Island Sound, blue and hazy, and dotted
with sails and streaked with smoke from distant
steamers. Past the Kingdon Gymnasium he went,
and then the path descended toward the river, between
the tennis courts, and he paused for a minute
behind one of the back-stops to watch a game
in progress between two white-flanneled youths
whose dexterity with racquet and ball made him
wonder. At his right, a quarter of a mile away,
figures moved over the rolling hillside, now stopping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
for some mysterious reason and then marching
determinedly away again. Kendall had never
seen golf played and the movements of the fellows
in the distance seemed exceedingly strange.
But, for that matter, there was a good deal that
was strange to him here at Yardley. And perhaps
the strangest thing of all was being here!
It still seemed more like a dream than a reality,
and he was constantly in fear that he would
wake up.</p>

<p>The field was almost empty when he reached it,
for it still wanted more than a quarter of an hour
to four o’clock, and many of the upper class fellows
had three o’clock recitations. But a few boys were
scattered around, some on the stands and some,
in football regalia, waiting for work. The gridiron
had been freshly marked out and the lime
lines were dazzlingly white against the grass.
Kendall wished there was somebody he might talk
to, but so far he had formed no acquaintances beyond
those we know of, and to address any of
the careless, laughing fellows about him without
overtures from them was quite beyond him. So
he seated himself in the sun on one of the steps
leading into the grand stand and waited. Behind
him and about him there were many amused
glances and whispered remarks, but Kendall
never noticed. On the river a canoe with two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
boys at the paddles was working slowly against
the current toward Flat Island. Beyond the
stream a wide expanse of marshland was showing
the first signs of autumn, stretches of yellow
mingling with the green of rushes and grass.
Singly and in groups of two and three the boys,
players and onlookers alike, began to appear
around the corner of the stand. Then came Dan
Vinton in earnest converse with John Payson,
the coach. They passed him only a few yards
distant and he wondered whether the captain
would recognize him. But he didn’t, although
his eyes rested idly for a moment on his face as
he passed on. Then a little red-haired Irishman
appeared with a push-cart which he wheeled to
the front of the grand stand amidst facetious
greetings from the audience:</p>

<p>“Hello, Andy! how’s the boy?”</p>

<p>“The top o’ the morning to ye, Andy!”</p>

<p>“Well, see who’s here!”</p>

<p>“Andy, I believe your hair’s faded!”</p>

<p>The trainer waved a freckled hand toward the
seats and began to unload his cart. There were
dozens of gray blankets, a gunny sack full of footballs,
nose guards, pails, sponges, a can of water
and numerous other treasures. Andy inverted
the gunny sack and the footballs came tumbling
out and went bobbing about in all directions to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
pounced on by eager hands. A whistle blew and
order resolved out of chaos. The candidates clustered
around the coach and captain, Kendall following
the others. He couldn’t hear very well
what the coach was saying, since he was quite on
the fringe of the crowd, but he caught occasional
fragments:</p>

<p>“... Necessary to learn the rudiments of the
game ... seem like hard work, but it’s work that
pays well in the end.... You can’t build a house
without a foundation and you can’t build a football
team without.... Men who played last year
report to Roeder.... New men stay here....
On the jump, now!”</p>

<p>I don’t intend to weary the reader with a detailed
account of Kendall’s experiences that afternoon.
They were uninteresting, or would have
been save for their novelty. Kendall found himself
one of a group of twenty fellows in charge
of a quick-spoken, gingery little chap whom he
afterwards discovered to be Holmes, the second-choice
quarter-back. Now and then Payson made
his appearance and looked on for a moment, sometimes
dropping criticism or encouragement. The
work for the awkward squad consisted wholly in
accustoming themselves to the handling of the
ball. They passed it about in a big circle, passed
it at a walk, passed it at a trot. Then they tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
dropping on it as Holmes rolled it along the
ground, and finally they were made to catch it on
the bound and to pick it up on the run as it dribbled
along in front of them. Later they were
formed in a line on one of the white marks and
taught to start quickly as the quarter snapped the
ball back.</p>

<p>It was tiresome work, although Kendall only
discovered that when it was all over and he was
walking back up the hill, walking alone amongst
more than a hundred boys and wistfully wishing
that he had someone with whom to talk over the
practice. It seemed to Kendall that he was the
only boy in school who hadn’t friends or acquaintances.
He had been instructed to stop at the
gymnasium and have his name entered in the manager’s
book. So he followed the crowd through
the big oak doors, down a flight of broad steps and
into the locker-room. The manager proved to be
an harassed-looking youth whom the others addressed
as Cowles or Mister Manag<em>eer</em>. It seemed
the proper thing to do to confuse Cowles as much
as possible, and the manager was continually begging
mercy.</p>

<p>“Oh, for the love of mud, Jensen, cut out the
rough-house, will you?” he was imploring as Kendall
edged up. “I’ve got your old name down
here already.... What’s that, Fogg? I don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
know; ask Payson.... What’s the name, you
fellow?”</p>

<p>“Burtis.”</p>

<p>“Curtis. What class?”</p>

<p>“Not Curtis, if you please; Bur—”</p>

<p>“Shut up, you fellows, can’t you? I can’t hear
a word. What’s your class, Curtis?”</p>

<p>“Third.”</p>

<p>“Where’re you rooming?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-one Clarke Hall.”</p>

<p>“How old?”</p>

<p>“Fifteen; pretty near sixteen.”</p>

<p>“Never mind the pretty near part. Squad D.
Report to-morrow to Mr. Bendix at twelve for
examination. Come on, now, I haven’t got all
night to do this!”</p>

<p>Kendall pushed his way through the crowded
room toward the door. Most of the fellows, he
noticed, were changing their football clothes for
their usual attire in front of little closets which
ran in rows at one end of the room. Some, already
disencumbered of everything save huge
bath towels, were hurrying toward a doorway
from beyond which came the sound of rushing
water and eddying clouds of steam. In there,
Kendall surmised, were the shower baths. He
had heard of them and would like to have tried
one, but he had neither towel nor locker. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
stood for a moment out of the way and watched
the scene. Dan Vinton came hurrying through
the outer door and pushed his way through the
throng. Several fellows tried to detain him, but
he kept on to a bench and rapidly removed his
togs, talking as he did so to half a dozen fellows
who had followed and quickly surrounded him.
In a minute he was off to the showers, still replying
to questions as he went and eluding the
clutches of friends. Across the room Cowles was
still taking names, although his task was about
over. The throng began to lessen as the baths
swallowed their quota. Kendall turning to reach
the door suddenly became aware of a boy who,
a yard or two distant, was viewing him uncertainly.
It was the boy to whom Kendall had been
introduced last night in Vinton’s room, but he
couldn’t recall his name. He was in ordinary
attire and looked as though he had just entered.
When he caught Kendall’s eye he nodded smilingly
and stepped across to him.</p>

<p>“We met last night, but I’ve forgotten your
name,” he said.</p>

<p>“I remember,” Kendall replied a trifle shyly.
“My name is Burtis.”</p>

<p>“Burtis? I don’t think I’ve ever heard that
before. Mine is Pennimore. How did you get
on at practice, Burtis?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not very well, I guess.”</p>

<p>“One doesn’t at first. It’s a bit discouraging.
After you’ve got the hang of it, though, it goes
better.” He surveyed the room and finally called
across to the manager. “Cowles, where’s Dan?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen him, Gerald,” Cowles replied,
waving his book and then slipping it into his
pocket.</p>

<p>“If you mean Mr. Vinton,” said Kendall, “he
went into the bathroom about two or three minutes
ago.”</p>

<p>“Did he? I guess I won’t wait then. Coming
my way?”</p>

<p>“I—I was going back to my room,” replied
Kendall.</p>

<p>“Let’s walk along, then. Well, how do you like
it as far as you’ve got?” Gerald held the door
open and Kendall murmured “Thank you,” and
went through.</p>

<p>“I like it very much,” he replied when they
were outside on the path. “It—it’s different,
though, from what I expected.”</p>

<p>“Is it? How?”</p>

<p>“Well, everything’s bigger, for one thing,” replied
Kendall hesitatingly. “And—and the fellows
are—are different.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you like us?” laughed Gerald.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! That is, I don’t know anyone yet—except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the fellow I room with, but you all seem
very nice. I don’t know that I can explain just
what I mean.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead and try,” Gerald encouraged.</p>

<p>“Well, everyone seems so—so old!”</p>

<p>“Old?”</p>

<p>“Yes, more like fellows in college, you know.”</p>

<p>“Really? I never thought of that.”</p>

<p>“Maybe old isn’t quite the word I want,” said
Kendall reflectively. “No, I don’t guess it is.
What I mean is that the fellows are so—so sort
of confident, and—and—oh, I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“I get you now,” replied Gerald. “Yes, I know
what you mean. I noticed that myself when I
came. It’s a sort of self-possession, isn’t it? You
soon catch it, Burtis. You see, after all, Yardley
is a good deal like a college. A fellow has to
look after himself a good deal. They give us lots
of rope here and you can hang yourself mighty
easy, Burtis. Some fellows don’t understand that
when they first come. They think that because
they’re not watched by someone every minute
that they can do as they please and it won’t matter.
But it does matter, though. There’s no one
here to say, ‘Now you must study your lessons
and be a good boy,’ you see. Only when you <em>don’t</em>
study your lessons, and <em>aren’t</em> a good boy, you
get into trouble. A fellow can get along maybe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
half a term by faking, but when the exams come
there’s a—a rude awakening, as they say in the
stories. And then it’s too late. Out you go!
Good night! So a fellow has to learn to look
after himself here; has to realize that if he’s going
to stay here he’s got to do things on his own
incentive, and not wait to be told. If you don’t
want to study here at Yardley, no one’s going to
make you. Only some fine day you wake up and
find that your trunk’s packed and that you’ve got
your ticket home.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Kendall thoughtfully. “That accounts
for it, I guess.”</p>

<p>Gerald’s discourse had brought them to the
doorway of Clarke and now they climbed the stairs
together. Kendall wanted to ask the other boy
to his room, but feared it might be considered
“fresh.” Gerald solved the problem at the head
of the stairs.</p>

<p>“Come down to my room and chin awhile,” he
said, leading the way along the hall. “Unless you
want to change.”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll wait now,” answered Kendall. Gerald
pointed out the easiest chair to his guest,
tossed his cap onto his bed and tossed himself
onto the window seat, stuffing the many-hued pillows
behind his back.</p>

<p>“There’s another thing,” said Kendall, returning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
to the subject. “Everyone seems to be having
such a good time.”</p>

<p>“Why not? That’s what we’re here for!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but—but what about studying and—and
learning things?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t worry,” Gerald laughed. “We
study, Burtis. But we try to have a good time
even doing that. I guess it’s a sort of pose here
at Yardley to seem careless and happy-go-lucky
and keep on smiling. Life isn’t always a joke, not
by any means; but we don’t believe in drawing
long faces, Burtis. They say over at Broadwood
that a Yardley man never knows when he’s
beaten; and there’s something in that, too. I said
a minute ago that it was a pose. It isn’t, though;
it’s a habit. Oh, you’ll like us better when you
learn our ways.”</p>

<p>“I like you now,” replied Kendall with a smile.
“Only I didn’t quite understand. I’m glad you’ve
told me.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you don’t know many fellows yet?”</p>

<p>“No, none to speak of.”</p>

<p>“Well, you will in a day or two if you keep
on with football. And you must come over here
now and then. Fellows drop in here a good deal,
you know. How do you like Towne?”</p>

<p>“I—it’s pretty soon to judge yet,” replied Kendall
evasively. Gerald laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, don’t judge us all by him,” he begged.</p>

<p>“I guess I looked pretty much of a fool last
night,” said Kendall sheepishly. “About that application
blank, I mean.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; well, that was a bit green, but I don’t
know why you shouldn’t have believed Towne.
We’re all pretty innocent when we get here first.
And, by the way, Burtis, I ought to tell you, I
guess, that we don’t say ‘sir’ to one another here.
I noticed last night that you said it to Dan.”</p>

<p>“Thanks; I’ll remember,” replied Kendall
gratefully. “Only he was older and the football
captain and I somehow thought—”</p>

<p>“There was no harm done,” Gerald assured
him. “Not a bit. But you needn’t say ‘sir’ or
‘mister’ to anyone except faculty, you know, and
Mr. Payson. Let’s see, you’re in the Third,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Third Class? Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, any time you want help come over. I’ve
been through with it and I know it’s mighty hard
sledding in places. I’m not a ‘grind’ by any
means, but I might be able to help you out of
a hole maybe.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I will. I guess I’ll be going
now.”</p>

<p>“All right. Come over and see me sometimes.
By the way, ever done any running?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“Running?” repeated Kendall.</p>

<p>“Yes, on the track.” Kendall shook his head.</p>

<p>“Well, you’d better come out in the spring and
try for the Track Team,” said Gerald. “With
those legs of yours you ought to be able to
just eat up the cinders. Good-by. See you
again.”</p>

<p>Kendall found Harold Towne stretched out on
his bed, reading.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said Harold, “how did you like—”
Then he caught sight of Kendall’s attire and a
broad grin overspread his face. “Well, say,
where on earth did you get that costume?”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with it?” asked Kendall
in surprise.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with it! You look like a
scarecrow! Have you been out for practice like
that?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I hadn’t anything else. Vinton said—”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll bet you made ’em laugh, Burtis.
Say, don’t tell anyone you room with me, will
you?”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” replied Kendall emphatically. Harold
stared a moment. There was something in
the tone he didn’t like. Finally,</p>

<p>“Where have you been since practice?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I stopped at the gymnasium for a few minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and then walked home with a fellow named
Pennimore, and I’ve been in his room.”</p>

<p>“Pennimore! Gerald Pennimore?”</p>

<p>“I think his name’s Gerald,” replied Kendall,
squirming out of his sweater. Harold whistled.
Then he chuckled:</p>

<p>“I’d like to have seen you together, you two.
The millionaire and the scarecrow, eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” returned Kendall
with a scowl.</p>

<p>“I mean you and your friend, Mr. Moneybags.
Didn’t you know he’s the richest fellow in school?
And the biggest snob?”</p>

<p>“No.” Kendall shook his head and thought a
moment. “I guess this was another Pennimore,”
he said. “He was just like anyone else—only
nicer.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>KENDALL LEARNS OF A PLOT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">A week passed very quickly and left Kendall
pretty well shaken down into his place
at Yardley. During that week there were
five days of practice on the gridiron and he reported
promptly and regularly. I wish I could
say that he showed promise of becoming a good
player, but I can’t. As a matter of fact, he exhibited
about as little aptitude for the game as
any member of Squad D, and that isn’t flattering
since Squad D was made up of what in school
slang were known as “dubs.” It wasn’t that Kendall
was not willing enough; he’d have worked his
feet off to learn to play football well; but he was
undeniably awkward in movement and astonishingly
slow at getting started. He performed his
tasks with a kind of ferocious earnestness that
ought to have shown better results.</p>

<p>On Saturday of that week there was no practice,
for the weather was unusually warm for the
last of September and many of the candidates
were showing the effect of the work. Kendall was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
left with a whole afternoon on his hands with
which he didn’t know what to do. After his English
lesson at two he strolled back to his room half
hoping that Harold would be there. He didn’t
like that roommate of his very well, but to-day
even Harold would have been better than no one.
But the room was empty when he reached it. He
tossed his books onto the table, thrust his hands
into his pockets and walked to the window. It
was too fine an afternoon to stay indoors, he
decided, and so he went out again. In the hallway
he glanced undecidedly toward the door of
Number 28, but his courage failed him.</p>

<p>He had met Gerald Pennimore three or four
times since the day they had walked back from
the gymnasium together, but only for a moment
on each occasion. Once they had passed on the
stairs and perhaps thrice they had nodded and
spoken in Oxford. But Kendall had not taken
advantage of the other’s invitation to call. Since
he had learned that Gerald was the son of John
T. Pennimore, whose fame had reached even to
Roanoke, Kendall had doubted the sincerity of
that invitation. It didn’t seem reasonable that
a boy of Gerald Pennimore’s position should
really want to make a friend of him. To-day,
though, he would have given a good deal for Gerald’s
companionship. But the door at the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of the hall was closed and it was more than likely
that the room was empty. Kendall descended the
stairs and, with no objective point in mind,
mooned along the path toward the field.</p>

<p>The tennis courts were filled and he stood for
some time and looked on. On the baseball diamonds
two games seemed to be in progress and
the shouts and laughter of the players reached
him at the courts. But when he took up his journey
again his steps led him toward the boathouse
where a number of figures were visible about the
float. Up and down the river in the warm afternoon
sunlight many gayly hued canoes were gliding.
At the boathouse Kendall loitered for some
minutes, watching several craft start away and
wishing that some of the merry crews would invite
him along as a passenger, since he knew no
more about paddling or rowing than the average
boy whose life has been spent on a farm where
the largest body of water within five miles is a
six-foot brook. But none of the mariners asked
him to accompany them on their voyages and
after awhile Kendall left the float and wandered
downstream along the bank of the river.</p>

<p>On the other side was Meeker’s Marsh, and at
intervals enticing little inlets emptied into the
larger stream. Kendall wished he were over
there that he might explore some of them. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
was quite warm, in spite of the breeze that blew
across the marsh, and Kendall pushed his straw
hat away from his forehead, dug his hands into
his pockets and loitered slowly along, whistling
a tune. He was a little bit lonely, if the truth
is to be told, a little bit inclined for the first time
to be homesick. He wondered if he would ever
know fellows and enter into the good times about
him.</p>

<p>Presently a small island came into view, and
then, a little further downstream, a railway
bridge. He determined to cross that and return
along the opposite bank to the marsh. But when
the railway bridge was reached there was another
just beyond, a bridge for wagons and pedestrians,
and Kendall chose that instead. Once across it
a new idea came to him. He would keep on by
the dusty road and visit Greenburg. There would
be stores with things in the windows, and probably
a place where he could buy a glass of soda
water or root beer; for he was decidedly thirsty
after his walk in the sun. The thought quite
cheered him and the whistled tune became louder.</p>

<p>Five minutes on the dusty road brought him to
the edge of the town proper and windows with
fascinating goods began. Those windows had a
deal of attraction for the country-bred boy and
more than once his hand sought his trousers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
pocket enquiringly as some object more than usually
alluring tempted him. He had been quite
lavishly supplied with spending money by his
father when he had left home, and then, afterwards,
his mother had taken him aside and thrust
a whole five dollar bill into his hand. Of course
he didn’t have all that wealth with him; he had
heard often enough of the danger of carrying
money about in the cities; but there was a whole
half dollar in his pocket, to say nothing of some
nickels and coppers. But Kendall had never
learned extravagance, and a thing had to be pretty
tempting to make him part with any of his hoard.
And so he reached the very middle of Greenburg,
where the big dry-goods store is, and the two
banks, and the Palace of Sweets, and Wallace’s
drug store, without having yielded. But when he
heard the <em>siz-z-z</em> of the soda fountain in Wallace’s
he knew that the moment had come.</p>

<p>Greenburg is quite a busy, citified place on a
fine Saturday afternoon, and the drug store was
well filled with customers when Kendall went in.
They were two deep in front of the white marble
counter and most of the little wire-legged tables
were surrounded by thirsty mortals of both sexes.
There were so many enticing concoctions advertised
on the wall behind the two busy clerks and
the ornate fountain that Kendall didn’t know what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to choose; “Walnut Fudge Sundae”—“Chocolate
Egg-and-Milk”—“Orange and Lime”—“Claret
Frappé”—“Fresh Fruit College Ices”—“Myer’s
Root Beer”—“Choco-Cola”—and
more besides. Kendall fingered his coins and debated
while he waited a chance to make his wants
known. When, suddenly, a clerk fixed him with
imperative gaze over the shoulder of a very stout
lady who was eating a college ice, Kendall was
quite unprepared and glanced wildly at the wall.
The first sign his eyes rested on was “Chocolate
Egg-and-Milk” and so he said “Chocolate Egg-and-Milk”
to the clerk, wishing the very next instant
he had chosen something he was acquainted
with. The clerk held out a hand.</p>

<p>“Check, please,” he demanded.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Kendall.</p>

<p>“Get your check at the cashier’s desk, please,”
said the clerk. “What’s yours, madam?”</p>

<p>Kendall discovered the cashier’s desk and
pushed his half dollar across the ledge. “Five,
ten or fifteen?” asked the young lady behind the
grilling.</p>

<p>Kendall wavered. Then, “Ten, if you please,”
he said, and a blue celluloid check was passed
out and some change. Back at the counter he
was forced to await his chance again. When it
came it was another clerk who asked his order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and Kendall passed over his blue check and said,
“Root beer, please.”</p>

<p>“Two?”</p>

<p>“No, just one.”</p>

<p>“Root beer’s only five cents,” was the reply.
“This is a ten cent check.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” Kendall stammered. “Then I—I’ll
take a chocolate egg-and-milk, please.”</p>

<p>“That’s fifteen cents,” replied the clerk impatiently.</p>

<p>“Oh—er—er—ice-cream soda!” blurted Kendall.</p>

<p>“What flavor?”</p>

<p>“Er—er—what have you got?”</p>

<p>The clerk waved a hand toward the wall.
“There they are,” he said with an air of long-suffering
and a wink at a tall boy who was gathering
up four glasses of college ice. Kendall’s
gaze swept the list unseeingly.</p>

<p>“Vanilla, please,” he said meekly.</p>

<p>The tall boy pushed past him with an amused
look and Kendall saw that he bore his purchases
to one of the small tables at the other side of
the store where three other youths sat awaiting
him. When Kendall’s own glass was handed to
him, a long-handled spoon sticking out from the
top and a paper napkin thrust into the handle,
he drew aside and looked for a place to enjoy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
it at his leisure. At that moment a small table
in a far corner was vacated and Kendall made
his way to it. A tired-looking rubber plant
drooped dejectedly above it and its surface was
littered with empty glasses and crumpled napkins.
But Kendall pushed these aside, placed his own
delectable concoction before him and seated himself.</p>

<p>It was awfully good, that ice cream, cold and
sweet and fragrant with vanilla, and just
“sting-y” enough with the soda. The first spoonful
brought content and the second joy. After
that he decided to make it last as long as possible,
and so he leaned back in the little chair and
looked about him. At the next table, only a scant
yard away, was the tall youth and his three companions.
Kendall supposed at first that they
were Yardley fellows, but their conversation was
of things quite foreign to his knowledge and
when, presently, he saw that one of the quartette
wore a dark green cloth cap with a white
B on it he realized that he was looking for the
first time on the enemy.</p>

<p>Broadwood Academy, Yardley’s rival, was situated
about two miles from Greenburg in the opposite
direction. Although slightly smaller than
Yardley in point of enrollment, it was counted
among the foremost preparatory schools of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
East. Of course, at Yardley they made fun of it;
called it a “fresh water school” because it stood
inland, and pretended that it was a joke. But
for all of that Broadwood Academy had long
proved herself a worthy rival to the older school.
Unlike Yardley, Broadwood prohibited her students
from going to Greenburg on all days save
Saturdays, unless by special permission, and as
a consequence Saturday afternoon found the
main street well sprinkled with wearers of the
green.</p>

<p>Kendall viewed the four with new interest.
They seemed rather nice-looking fellows, he
thought. But already the Yardley fealty was beginning
to take hold of him and he added to himself
that they lacked something that Yardley
boys had. As though to offer evidence, two Yardley
fellows entered just then and called for sodas.
Kendall knew them both by sight and one by
name. The taller of the pair was Arthur Thompson,
a First Class boy, captain of the Track Team
and a pole-vaulter of some reputation. He was
trying for the Football Team, too, for Kendall
had seen him at practice several times. The other
boy was considerably younger; younger even than
Kendall; later the latter was to learn that his
name was Harry Merrow. There <em>was</em> a difference
between these two and the Broadwood quartette,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
although Kendall couldn’t have indicated
it very clearly, and the difference, Kendall stoutly
held, was in favor of the Yardlians. They consumed
their beverages at the counter and presently
passed out again to the street. They had
not gone unnoticed by the Broadwood fellows,
however; Kendall heard the latter discussing
them in low voices.</p>

<p>“That’s Thompson,” said one, “the tall fellow.
He’s their crack pole-vaulter. He was in
wrong with the Office last year and couldn’t vault,
but he will show us a thing or two next spring.
They say he’s about the best prep school chap
in his line, and I heard that two or three colleges
have been making love to him.”</p>

<p>“He’s a rangy looking customer,” said another.
“I hope we don’t run up against a bunch
like him to-night. I like fun, but I’m not looking
for slaughter.”</p>

<p>“Don’t shout,” counseled a third in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t. Besides, there isn’t a Yardley fellow
in sight.”</p>

<p>To make sure all four glanced about them.
Their gaze passed over Kendall unsuspectingly.
It never occurred to any of them that the countrified
looking youth in ill-fitting pepper-and-salt
clothes was a Yardlian. Kendall was diligently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
consuming his ice-cream soda and apparently was
not even conscious of the quartette’s existence.</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow,” pursued the remonstrant,
“keep your voice down. You never know who’s
going to hear.”</p>

<p>“For my part,” said another, “I wouldn’t mind
a little rough-house with those chaps up there.
They think they’re the only thing in the state
of Connecticut, the conceited pups!”</p>

<p>“What time did Hurd say he’d have the carriage
up there?”</p>

<p>“Nine-thirty. I told him to stop about a hundred
yards this side of the corner and wait until
we came; told him he might have to wait an
hour.”</p>

<p>“We won’t be able to get away until after ten.
What’s the use having him come so early?”</p>

<p>“So he will be on time. If I’d said ten he’d
been there about half-past, probably.”</p>

<p>“How long will it take to get to Yardley?”</p>

<p>“Three-quarters of an hour, I guess. We’ll
leave the carriage at the foot of the hill and
sneak up on foot.”</p>

<p>“How many brushes did you get, Jim?”</p>

<p>“Two,” replied the tall youth.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with four, one for each of
us?”</p>

<p>“You can slap on the paint if you want to,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
was the reply. “I’m not crazy about it. But
somebody has got to keep watch. Besides, if
more than two of us try to paint the pole we’ll
get in each other’s way.”</p>

<p>“I think we ought to paint a few B’s around,
so they’ll know who did it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that would be a fine scheme!” said another
sarcastically. “You must want to get fired
from school. They’d raise a row at Yardley and
we’d get found out. I don’t half like the idea of
that carriage, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, they aren’t going to tell at the livery
stable. Besides, I don’t intend to walk all the
way, and you can bet on that!”</p>

<p>“You talk like a rabbit,” said a former speaker.
“Don’t you suppose they’re going to know who
painted their old flagpole even if we don’t sign
our name to the job?”</p>

<p>“The fellows up there will know, but the faculty
won’t be sure it wasn’t some of their own
chaps. They have class colors up there, and
green’s one of them.”</p>

<p>“Green and white; Third Class,” corroborated
another. “Wouldn’t it be a peach of a joke if
they blamed their own Third Class fellows for
it?”</p>

<p>“Dandy! Come on and let’s get back.”</p>

<p>They arose from their table and sauntered out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Their conversation had been conducted for the
most part in low tones and Kendall had missed
a word here and there, but more than enough had
reached him to give him a very good idea of the
plot. What it all meant was beyond him, however.
Why those fellows should want to drive
at ten o’clock at night all the way to Yardley to
paint a flagpole green he couldn’t see. Evidently,
though, it was a sort of practical joke on
Yardley. It seemed to him a lot of bother for
a small result.</p>

<p>He saw the Broadwood boys out of sight and
then left the store himself. He forgot all about
the window displays on the way back along the
street, being busy with his thoughts. Of course
he ought to tell someone about the prank, but
he wondered who. Harold Towne somehow
didn’t recommend himself in such an emergency.
Of course he had no thought of telling the faculty;
he had very well-settled ideas of right and
wrong, and to inform the faculty and probably
get the conspirators into trouble would be, in
his opinion, talebearing pure and simple; which
is something that a right-minded boy holds in the
deepest contempt. Then he thought of Gerald
Pennimore and of Dan Vinton, and he had about
made up his mind to seek the former when he
reached school when an entirely new and brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
idea came to him. He stopped short in the road
and gave vent to an expressive whistle. Finally
he said “Why not?” aloud, nodded his head twice
and went on.</p>

<p>When he reached the school boundary at the
foot of The Prospect he stopped and studied the
lay of the land.</p>

<p>“Here,” he said to himself, “is about where
the carriage will stop. Then they’ll get out
and—”</p>

<p>He paused there. The flagpole stood in the
middle of The Prospect, a natural terrace in front
of Oxford Hall. He glanced up at it from the
foot of the hill. The stars and stripes hung motionless
from the halyards. To reach the pole
the enemy might either follow the roadway, which
wound up the hill at the expense of distance, or
ascend the steep, grassy slope of The Prospect.
Kendall believed they would do the latter, since
they would be out of sight until they reached the
top. Further to the left there was a footpath
up the slope, but that would bring them out almost
in front of Merle and some distance from
their scene of operations. In any case, he decided,
if the enemy was to be foiled in its nefarious
designs it must be when they had reached
the flagpole. Luckily, the entrance to Oxford
Hall provided a perfect place of concealment for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the repulsing force. Kendall wondered whether
there would be a moon, recalled the fact that there
had been none last night and concluded that only
the stars would be likely to illumine the scene.
He wanted to try the ascent up the slope himself
just to see if it was practicable, but several fellows
were in sight returning from Greenburg
and he decided not to. Instead he made his way
to Whitson along the drive, found Number 21
deserted and, curling himself on the window seat,
set about perfecting his plan. Once he arose,
crossed to the table, picked up Harold’s electric
torch and dropped it into his pocket. Then he
went back to the window seat and his plotting.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>AND FOILS IT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Kendall thought Harold would never get
to sleep that night. Hoping that his roommate
would follow the example, Kendall
piled into bed at half-past nine, but Harold, who
usually yawned all through study hour and got
between the sheets as soon as possible afterwards,
to-night displayed a most unusual and annoying
wakefulness. Even after he was in bed
and the light was out he wanted to talk, and only
stopped when Kendall simulated slumber by
making hideous noises in his throat. Had Harold
been of an observant nature he would have remarked
on the sudden development of this accomplishment,
for Kendall had never been known
to snore until to-night.</p>

<p>It was long after ten o’clock when regular
breathing from across the room told Kendall that
his roommate was asleep. He waited five minutes
more to make certain and then arose softly,
donned trousers and jacket over his nightgown—Kendall
had not yet become so stylish as to affect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
pajamas—and thrust his bare feet into his
canvas “sneakers.” Making certain that the
electric torch was in his pocket, he opened the
room door noiselessly and peeked out. The dimly
lighted hall was empty. Leaving his door slightly
ajar, he scuttled to the stairway and stole down.
Two of the faculty, Mr. Collins, the Assistant
Principal, and Mr. Frye, lived on the lower floor
and Kendall had no desire to encounter them.
Mr. Collins’s transom, however, was dark, and
although a light showed in Mr. Frye’s study, it
was further down the corridor and well out of
sound.</p>

<p>As he expected, the big outer door was locked.
But the key was on the inside and it turned without
a squeak. The door was not so quiet, but
it is doubtful if it made nearly so much noise as
Kendall thought. He crept through with his
heart in his throat, feeling like a burglar leaving
the scene of his depredations. In another moment
he was swallowed in the darkness.</p>

<p>Cautiously, treading on the grass and keeping
as close as he might to the front of the buildings,
he made his way to Oxford. All was quiet as yet.
As his eyes became accustomed to the darkness
he found that he could see for some little distance.
There was the flagpole, a grayish streak
in the gloom, and he thought he could make out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the edge of The Prospect beyond. Some stars
showed, but for the most part they were obscured
by clouds. It was an ideal night for desperate
deeds, Kendall reflected, and he shivered pleasurably
as he ensconced himself in the doorway of
Oxford. He wondered what time it was, but had
no way of determining. Suddenly a drumming
sound reached him and he listened acutely. It
grew and grew and at last resolved itself into
the rush of a night freight bearing down from
the east. Presently a ruddy glow smote the darkness
away to the left as the fireman fed coal to
the pounding engine. Then all was blackness
again, and the roar of the train as it rushed
through the cut a little distance away filled the
night. After a moment Kendall could see the tail
lights as the train swept across the bridge into
Greenburg. Hoarse and low came the distant
whistle of a steamer on the Sound. Then quiet
settled down again.</p>

<p>Although the day had been unseasonably warm,
the night held a chill that was fast getting
through Kendall’s scant attire. And the stones
felt very cold under the worn soles of his rubber
“sneakers.” He wished that the enemy would
make its appearance and have done with it. And
at almost the same minute, as though in answer
to his wish, there reached him faintly the sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of a creaking carriage from beyond the slope.
The sounds ceased. Kendall, straining sight and
hearing, waited, his heart pounding against his
ribs. Minute after minute passed. Time and
again his imagination peopled The Prospect with
skulking figures, and more than once he was certain
that he heard voices. But when the enemy
did appear it was from an unsuspected quarter.</p>

<p>Kendall had been so sure that they would creep
up over the edge of The Prospect that he never
took his eyes from that direction until a sound
at his left, the faintest sound imaginable, summoned
his gaze. They had come by the drive,
after all, banking, doubtless, on the darkness to
remain undetected. When Kendall first saw them
they were almost halfway across the turf between
the drive and the flagpole, which, from where he
hid in the entrance of Oxford, was a scant twelve
yards distant.</p>

<p>Kendall’s hand, which had been clutching the
electric torch for many minutes, tightened and
his finger sought the button. But he waited a
moment longer, waited while they reached the
flagpole, four darker blots in the darkness, and
paused there. Then two of the forms separated
from the others, one advancing to the right and
the other to the left and kneeling, apparently, on
the turf. Only once the sound of a voice reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Kendall. Then he thought he heard the word
“brush” uttered in a low tone. And then up
went his arm, his finger pressed on the button
and—</p>

<p>Darkness as before!</p>

<p>The torch had failed to work! Frantically
Kendall pressed the button, but it was no use.
What was the matter? The torch had been all
right earlier in the evening, for he had tested it
more than once. Perhaps—! Hurriedly he unscrewed
the lens at the end and felt of the tiny
lamp inside. That was it! It had become sufficiently
unscrewed to break the connection. He
tightened it with trembling fingers, put back the
lens, again pointed it at the base of the flagpole
and pressed the button.</p>

<p>A path of white light leaped before him into
the darkness. In that brilliant flood of radiance
every object stood out sharp and distinct as
though in a flash of lightning. <a href="#i_fp074">At the pole</a>, frozen
into immobility, <a href="#i_fp074">stood a boy with upraised arm</a>.
Beside him a second boy leaned to dip his brush
in the can of paint. At the edge of the radiance,
to left and right, the two watchers knelt on the
grass like Indian scouts and gazed with wide,
frightened eyes into the glare of the torch. The
picture lasted but an instant. Then came one sudden
exclamation of alarm and four figures were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
scuttling for the edge of The Prospect, their
shadows fleeing before them. Then they were
gone. Kendall raced after. The light from the
torch swept the long, steep slope. Two of the
boys had reached the bottom safely, but the others
were rolling over and over, pellmell, legs
and arms thrashing the air as they went. But
not a sound escaped them. At the bottom they
picked themselves up and plunged into the blackness
beyond the limits of the torch’s radiance.</p>

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_75">“At the pole stood a boy with upraised arm.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>Kendall extinguished the light and stood for
a moment in silent laughter as he heard the creak
of the carriage, followed the next instant by the
sound of galloping hoofs on the road. Then silence
fell again. Still chuckling, he retraced his
steps across The Prospect. He had had some
idea at first of hiding the can of paint, but he
didn’t know where to put it. And, now that the
enemy was routed in disorder, it behooved him to
make good his own escape from a precarious
position. He wondered whether they had succeeded
in putting any of the paint on the pole
before their flight, but decided that he had better
not show the light again. He would learn to-morrow.</p>

<p>He crept silently back to Clarke and breathed
a sigh of relief when he found the door ajar as
he had left it. There had always been the possibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
that someone would come prowling
around, find it undone and relock it. But fortune,
it seemed, was with him to-night. He
pushed open the door, entered, closed it behind
him and noiselessly turned the key again. Then
he faced around and discovered himself looking
startledly into the eyes of the Assistant Principal!</p>

<p>Mr. Collins was clothed in a crimson bathgown,
the tasseled cords of which he was still in the
act of tying with fumbling fingers. He had evidently
just arisen from bed, and hurriedly. Kendall,
the electric torch still clasped in his left
hand, remained stock-still and regarded the brilliant
apparition with open mouth. It was the
apparition that spoke first.</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” asked Mr. Collins
sternly.</p>

<p>“Just—just outside, sir,” replied Kendall
vaguely.</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“Just—just to look around, sir; to get the air.
I—I wasn’t sleepy, please, sir, and I—I took a
walk.”</p>

<p>“Hm; really?” Mr. Collins’s tone was doubting.
“Didn’t you know it was against the rules
to leave the building after ten o’clock?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but I—I guess I forgot it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“You guess you forgot it, eh? What’s that in
your hand?”</p>

<p>Kendall looked down, saw the torch and regarded
it with a vast surprise, turning it this
way and that in an evident effort to account for
it. Finally, though,</p>

<p>“That’s an electric torch, sir,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Hm; so I see. What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Burtis, sir.”</p>

<p>“What’s your room?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-one, sir.”</p>

<p>“Go to it. I’ll talk with you to-morrow.
Wait!”</p>

<p>Kendall “waited” abruptly, almost losing his
balance.</p>

<p>“Are you alone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“No one else with you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Quite certain of that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Don’t let this happen again,
Curtis.”</p>

<p>“Burtis, please, sir. No, sir. Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>“Hm! Good night!”</p>

<p>But the encounter with Mr. Collins couldn’t
spoil the adventure. Unaided and alone, reflected
Kendall as he mounted the stairs to his room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
he had met the enemy and repulsed it! He had
saved the school from vandalism! He, Kendall
Burtis, had done it, and from now on they could
no longer disregard his existence. He was a
hero!</p>

<p>Of course, his thoughts continued as he crawled
into bed without disturbing the rhythmic breathing
of his roommate, of course Mr. Collins might
lecture him about leaving the building after
lock-up, but what was a lecture in view of his
triumph? Eventually Kendall fell asleep to
dream of the night’s events in weird parody, little
recking of the mischievous possibilities of
what is known as Circumstantial Evidence!</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">Kendall awoke the next morning possessed
by a pleasant feeling of well-being for
which he could not, during the first few moments,
account. Then recollection of the events
of the preceding night came and he smiled
broadly and mentally patted himself on the back.
He jumped out of bed and dressed himself
briskly, thinking that the world was a very good
place to be in. Harold, who was usually out of
sorts in the early morning, was visibly annoyed
at Kendall’s high spirits.</p>

<p>“Cut out that whistling, will you?” he begged
between yawns. “You give me a headache, you
do; always whistling; making a noise—” The
words died away in a growl as he patted the
cold sponge gingerly over his face. Kendall
laughed.</p>

<p>“I guess you don’t like music,” he said.</p>

<p>“Music!” exclaimed the other with awful
irony.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what the little birdies do in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
morning, whistle. I’m playing I’m a little
birdie.”</p>

<p>“You’re playing the silly fool,” growled Harold.
“Whistling isn’t music. Besides, there isn’t
any tune to what you whistle!”</p>

<p>“I was—what do you call it?—improvising,”
replied Kendall. “All great musicians do
it.”</p>

<p>“Well, do it outdoors then. I want peace in
my own room.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Kendall good-naturedly.
“I’m off. You’d better hurry or you’ll be late
for chapel.”</p>

<p>“Don’t care if I am,” answered Harold defiantly.
But he dropped the towel and made a
rush for his clothes as Kendall closed the door
behind him.</p>

<p>When Kendall reached the front of Whitson
he observed a little group of fellows at the flagpole.
He hurried across to it. On the grass,
overturned, lay the paint can, with two brushes,
sticky with green paint, balanced on top. The
brushes had been found on the grass nearby. A
glance at the pole told Kendall that he had not
entirely saved it from the enemy after all, for
on the farther side two big streaks of bright
green marred the whiteness. The group was
speculating excitedly. Kendall listened:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“Must have been done early last night. The
paint’s almost dry.”</p>

<p>“Some Third Class gang, of course. Green’s
their color.”</p>

<p>“They ought to get their heads bumped together,”
said an older boy. “Faculty’ll have
something to say when they see it.”</p>

<p>There was an uneasy silence at that, and one
or two of the smaller boys edged away. But others
joined the group and the theories kept
coming:</p>

<p>“Wonder why they didn’t finish it. Must have
been scared away, what?”</p>

<p>“Of course! Look at the paint pot. And
Decker found one brush ten feet away. They
probably heard something and ran.” The
speaker lowered his voice. “Know anything
about it?”</p>

<p>Then the chapel bell stopped ringing and the
fellows made a rush for the entrance.</p>

<p>Kendall smiled to himself as he followed. He
could tell them something that would surprise
them if he wanted to. Of course he would have
to tell someone or else he would get no credit for
his act; and it is only human nature to want
credit for our good deeds. The best way, he
guessed, would be to just sort of mention it carelessly
to someone. When one fellow knew, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
wouldn’t take long for the story to get about.
And after that—well, at least they’d know who
he was!</p>

<p>But presently, when Mr. Collins reached the
announcements for the day, Kendall was reminded
that life was not all roses.</p>

<p>“I will see the following students at the Office
at twelve,” said Mr. Collins. Then came a
half-dozen names, and the last of all was Burtis!</p>

<p>Kendall left Oxford wondering what sort of
punishment was to be meted out to him. It
seemed a very small crime, leaving the dormitory
after ten o’clock, and Kendall comforted himself
with the conclusion that the Assistant Principal
would only give him a talking to. But now and
then during the forenoon the recollection of the
coming interview caused a qualm.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the school had worked itself into
quite an excited frame of mind over the green
paint episode. Older fellows recalled the time
when, a couple of years ago, the front of Dudley
had been discovered decorated one morning with
a legend in blue paint. But the boy who had performed
that startling feat could not be connected
with the present adventure for he had removed
himself from Yardley a short while after.
Younger boys whispered of a mysterious secret
society and hinted that they had suspected its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
existence for some time. By noon the Third
Class had been made defendant. They might
deny it as much as they pleased, declared the
other classes, but anyone could see that it was
their work. And, added some of the First Class
oracles, the sooner they discovered the culprits
and made an example of them the better for the
reputation of the Third Class. All of which
added to the rapidly growing excitement. Of
course the Third Class denied to a man all knowledge
of the affair. Well, perhaps not to a man,
since Kendall didn’t put in any denial, the principal
reason for which was that no one thought
of accusing him.</p>

<p>By the time breakfast was over the paint can
and brushes had disappeared and the janitor was
busily at work removing the offending stains. It
was rumored that Mr. Collins himself had taken
the paint can, but when questioned the janitor
only grunted. It was also rumored that faculty
was enormously incensed over the affair and had
summoned a special meeting that evening to consider
what steps to take to discover the miscreants,
and that there was the dickens to pay
generally! Meanwhile the school waited with
bated breath and enjoyed the sensation hugely.</p>

<p>At twelve o’clock Kendall made his way down
the long corridor of Oxford and pushed open the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
ground-glass portal marked “Office.” There
were two boys ahead of him in the outer room
and Kendall sank into a chair to wait. The
school secretary glanced up across the top of his
desk, fixed Kendall speculatively for an instant
and went back to his work. The door of the inner
office opened, Mr. Collins appeared, looked
over the callers, said “Watkins, please,” and
disappeared again, one of the boys at his heels.
There was a solemnity about the proceeding that
Kendall found a trifle depressing. Five minutes
later the same thing was repeated and the second
youth disappeared behind that forbidding portal.
Meanwhile three other boys had arrived and
seated themselves about the room. Then it was
Kendall’s turn at last and he followed the Assistant
Principal across the threshold.</p>

<p>“Take a seat, please, Burtis,” said Mr. Collins,
closing the door. Kendall sat down in a
chair at the end of the broad, flat-topped mahogany
desk and Mr. Collins lowered a shade by a
few inches at one of the windows and took his
own chair. Then he looked at Kendall for a
moment in silence. Finally,</p>

<p>“Well, Burtis, suppose you tell me all about
it,” he said in a kindly tone. “That will save
a lot of questions.”</p>

<p>“Why, sir,” replied Kendall, “there—there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
isn’t anything much to tell, sir. I didn’t think
about the rule, sir. I don’t mean that I didn’t
know it, only—”</p>

<p>Mr. Collins frowned.</p>

<p>“Never mind about that part of it, Burtis.
What induced you to do such a silly, childish
thing, my boy?”</p>

<p>“Do—do what, Mr. Collins?”</p>

<p>“Come, come now! Don’t beat about the bush,
Burtis.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand what you mean, sir,” replied
Kendall bewilderedly. “If you mean why
did I go out after lock-up—”</p>

<p>“I mean,” said Mr. Collins shortly, drumming
with his finger-tips on the top of the desk, “I
mean why did you daub the flagpole with green
paint? What was your idea in doing such an
idiotic thing?”</p>

<p>Kendall stared in amazement.</p>

<p>“Why—why—”</p>

<p>“Well? Come now, tell me all about it.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t! You don’t understand, sir! I
didn’t have anything to do with that, Mr. Collins.
It was the oth—”</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly. Mr. Collins shook his
head impatiently:</p>

<p>“You mean that you didn’t actually do any of
the painting? Does that matter? You had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
hand in the affair, Burtis. Who was with
you?”</p>

<p>“No one, sir,” answered Kendall, still bewildered.</p>

<p>“That means you refuse to tell their names.
Do you mind telling me whether the thing was
intended as a Hallowe’en joke or as a mere piece
of vandalism?”</p>

<p>“Why, sir, I think it was meant as a joke!
But I didn’t know it was Hallowe’en. They
said—”</p>

<p>“Who said?” asked Mr. Collins sharply. Kendall
was silent.</p>

<p>“Come, come, Burtis, don’t be silly. Make a
frank confession and it will be easier for you.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather not say who they were, if you
please, sir. But I know they intended it as a
sort of joke on the school. I tried to stop them,
and I did, but I was too late—”</p>

<p>“So you were on the side of law and order,
were you?” asked Mr. Collins ironically. “Very
fine of you, Burtis. Then you don’t deny that
you were present at the time?”</p>

<p>“N-no, sir; that is, I was—was nearby.”</p>

<p>“Who did that electric torch you had belong
to?”</p>

<p>“My roommate, Harold Towne.”</p>

<p>“Hm. Where was Towne at the time?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“In bed, sir.”</p>

<p>“You’re certain of that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I waited until he was asleep before
I went out.”</p>

<p>“Were the others there when you arrived?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“You had to wait for them? How long?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know exactly; about twenty minutes,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“Where did you wait?”</p>

<p>“On the steps of Oxford, sir.”</p>

<p>“I see. You had the paint with you then?”</p>

<p>“No, sir! I didn’t have anything to do with
the paint. You—you don’t understand, Mr.
Collins!”</p>

<p>“I’m trying to, my boy, but you won’t help
me. You acknowledge that you took part in the
affair—”</p>

<p>“No, sir, really! I had nothing to do with it.
I went out to try and stop them.”</p>

<p>“That’s rather a hard pill to swallow, Burtis.
How did you know that ‘they’ were going to do
it?”</p>

<p>“I overheard them talking about it in the afternoon,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you try to stop them then?”</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t know them well enough.”</p>

<p>Mr. Collins was plainly puzzled. Kendall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
looked as though he were telling the truth, but
Mr. Collins had had many disillusionments in his
time. He moved impatiently. “Burtis,” he said,
“here are the clear facts of the case. I found
you last night at almost eleven o’clock coming
into the dormitory with an electric torch in your
hand. This morning the flagpole is found daubed
with green paint—the color of the Third Class,
of which you are a member—and a paint pot and
two brushes are found nearby. As circumstantial
evidence that looks pretty conclusive, doesn’t
it?”</p>

<p>Kendall sadly acknowledged that it did. It was
his first encounter with Circumstantial Evidence
and he was forced to own that Circumstantial
Evidence was getting the better of him.</p>

<p>“Well,” resumed the Assistant Principal,
“now you confess that you were aware of the
project, that you were present, know the other
participators—”</p>

<p>“Only by sight, sir!” interrupted Kendall.</p>

<p>“You mean that you don’t know their names?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir! No, sir; I mean that I don’t!”</p>

<p>“Um; members of your class, however, are they
not?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“What! Then why the green paint?”</p>

<p>“Because—because—” But Kendall couldn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
answer that without informing on the Broadwood
fellows.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t used because it was a class color,
sir; it—it had another significance.” And Kendall
found time to be secretly proud of that word
before Mr. Collins went on:</p>

<p>“Now you tell me that you went out there to
prevent the others from doing what they had
planned to do. What method did you intend to
use, Burtis?”</p>

<p>“I meant to scare them away.”</p>

<p>“Ah! And how did you propose to scare them
away?”</p>

<p>“By hiding and turning the searchlight on
them, sir. And that’s what I did, only the light
wouldn’t work at first and they got some paint
on before it would work. And then they ran
away.”</p>

<p>“Yes? And in what direction?”</p>

<p>“I—I—” Kendall stopped and observed Mr.
Collins apologetically. “I’d rather not tell any
more, please, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well, my boy, but bear in mind that you
are making it harder for yourself. I’d like very
much to believe your version of the story, but,
frankly, I can’t. Now, wouldn’t it be much more
sensible to make a clean breast of the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
thing? Is there any reason why the others
shouldn’t take their share of punishment? Especially
if, as you say, they are the ones to blame
and you are merely an innocent victim of circumstances?
Come, come, Burtis!”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t make a clean breast of it, Mr. Collins,
without telling on—on the others. And—and
you don’t think that’s right, do you, sir?”</p>

<p>Mr. Collins smiled slightly. “That question
has been put up to me a good many times, my boy,
and I’ve always declined to answer it. There’s
something to be said on both sides. It’s a question
you’ll have to decide for yourself. I must
tell you, though, that we have always had very
little patience for the sort of tomfoolery indulged
in by your party last night. Defacing property
is a skulking, mean-spirited business, Burtis.
Now and then some prank comes to my attention
for which, although I am obliged to mete out punishment,
I have a sort of admiration. Ingenuity,
daring, courage, all those compel admiration even
when displayed in a bad cause. But to sneak out
at night under cover of darkness and daub paint
on another person’s property has nothing of ingenuity
nor courage about it. In short, Burtis,
the defacing of school property is held by this
faculty as being mischievous and contemptible
and is always punished severely. I tell you this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
that you may realize the seriousness of your position
before it is too late. Think it over a minute.”</p>

<p>“You mean that I—that you will let me off if
I tell who the other fellows were?” asked Kendall
unhappily.</p>

<p>“I mean that if you will make a clean breast
of the whole affair, fixing blame where it belongs,
you will be dealt with much more leniently
than you will be if you persist in—in retarding
justice,” replied Mr. Collins kindly. “Take your
time and think about it.”</p>

<p>He arose and passed into the front office, and
Kendall heard him address Mr. Forisher, the secretary:</p>

<p>“Let me have the card of Burtis, Third Class,
please.”</p>

<p>He returned with the card in his hand. Kendall
could see his name at the top of it. It was evidently
taken from the filing cabinet which stood
back of the secretary’s desk. Mr. Collins laid
the card on the desk and looked inquiringly at
Kendall. Kendall shook his head:</p>

<p>“I—I’d rather not, please, sir.”</p>

<p>“You’re certain?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I’d rather not tell.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry.” Mr. Collins frowned slightly and
picked up the card. For a moment or two there
was silence while he glanced over the record it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
held. Then, “Upon my word, Burtis, this is too
bad,” he exclaimed annoyedly. “You have good
reports for the week from every instructor. Mr.
Bendix says you show first-class physical conditions
and that you are trying football. Here’s
a fine, clean card and now you go and spoil it by
such tomfoolery as last night’s! Too bad, really!
Well—”</p>

<p>He laid the card down again, drummed on the
desk with his fingers once or twice, swung his
chair around so that he could look out the window
across the Yard and was silent. A minute
passed. Kendall followed the Assistant Principal’s
gaze with his own and wondered how many
pillows were piled in the window seat of a room
in Dudley, how you told time by a sun-dial and
what the little red discs on the golf course meant.
Then Mr. Collins swung around briskly and Kendall
came back from his dreaming.</p>

<p>“Well, Burtis,” said Mr. Collins in a very matter-of-fact
tone of voice, “I guess it will have to
be probation.”</p>

<p>Kendall made no answer. He was very uncertain
as to what probation meant. He didn’t like
the sound of it, however. It sounded, he thought,
almost as bad as Circumstantial Evidence. Mr.
Collins didn’t leave him long in ignorance,
though:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“That means that you must keep within school
bounds, my boy, remain in your room from supper
time until chapel in the morning, have your
lessons perfect and abstain from athletics.”</p>

<p>“Does it mean,” asked Kendall blankly, “that
I mustn’t play football, sir?”</p>

<p>“Just that; neither football nor anything else.
And the rules oblige me to notify your”—he
glanced at the card—“your father, Burtis. I
shall write to him this evening. It would be well
for you to do the same, I think.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.” Kendall was silent
a moment, revolving his cap in his hands,
and looking very miserable. “I—I’m glad I
didn’t buy any football clothes,” he murmured
abstractedly. Mr. Collins smiled a little:</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all, Burtis, for this time, I think.
Try and let this teach you a lesson. Will you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” Kendall got up slowly. Mr. Collins
put out his hand and Kendall placed his
in it:</p>

<p>“Being on probation doesn’t prohibit you from
paying me a call sometimes, Burtis. You know
my room. Come in and see me. I’ve got some
books you might like to see, and I’m always glad
to loan them to boys who I believe will treat them
well.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir.” Kendall walked to the door.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
There, with his hand on the door, he turned.
“There’s—there’s just one thing, Mr. Collins,”
he said earnestly. “I know you had to—to do
this. I guess my story ain’t—I mean isn’t—very
likely. But I wish you’d just try your very hardest,
sir, to believe that I was telling the truth.”</p>

<p>“I will try, Burtis. If it is the truth, my boy,
it will prove itself some day. If it does you won’t
be more pleased than I shall. Good morning.”</p>

<p>“Good morning, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, by the way, Burtis! I shall say nothing
of this to anyone beyond the faculty. Unless you
speak of it yourself to your friends the reason for
your punishment is not likely to be known.”</p>

<p>When he passed Whitson the entrance was
thronged with fellows awaiting the dinner hour.
It seemed to him that, as he went by, everyone
turned and looked at him, and he could imagine
their expressions of amused contempt. To be
sure, Mr. Collins had seemed to think that the
matter would be kept secret, but it seemed to him
that everyone must know already. He passed by
on his way to his room with lowered head. As
a matter of fact, very few noticed him, and none
connected him with the green paint episode.</p>

<p>In his room Kendall washed up for dinner and
then sat down on the edge of his bed and strove
to think it over. He was very glad that Harold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
was not there. It would be nice to tell somebody
about it, but surely not him. There was the
electric torch on the table. He wondered if it
would light if he tried it. Funny how it had
come unscrewed last night. He would never forget
the scene when the light had streamed out
across The Prospect. He wondered what the four
Broadwood fellows thought of it; what explanation
they had fashioned to account for the sudden
surprise; whether they connected it with the boy
who had sat next to them in the drug store.</p>

<p>Then he pulled himself up. Why, he wasn’t
thinking of his misfortune at all! He was thinking
of what had happened when—when he had
been a hero. He felt mighty little like a hero to-day!
Probation! No more football! That was
tough. Worse than that, though, was the thought
of his father’s disappointment, and his mother’s.
He must write that letter and tell them the real
facts of it. It wasn’t doing very well, he reflected
ruefully, to get on probation within the
first fortnight of school!</p>

<p>Well—! A fellow had to eat, though, probation
or no probation, and he suddenly became aware
of a very healthy appetite. After all, he hadn’t
<em>really</em> done anything very bad, and he <em>had</em> told
the truth to Mr. Collins, and—and, oh, shucks, he
was going to dinner!</p>

<div class="chapter">

<small>THE FIRST GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Kendall wrote the letter to his father that
afternoon, about the time he was accustomed
to chase the pigskin. He felt rather
better after the letter was finished, and he took
it down and dropped it into the letter box in
front of Oxford Hall with a sigh of relief. At
least, his parents would know that his conscience
was clear. He wondered if his father would be
very angry with Mr. Collins! To anticipate a little,
however, Mr. Burtis’s reply when it reached
his son was not entirely satisfactory to that youth.
In the first place, asked that worthy Puritan, why
had Kendall been sitting around in a drug store?
Had he joined the town loafers? Satan, reminded
Farmer Burtis, was still finding mischief for idle
hands to engage in. Bluntly he suggested that
Kendall remain at school and study his lessons
and not go gallivanting into the city. As for the
punishment, he guessed it wouldn’t do Kendall
any harm to have to stay around the school and
keep away from the football field; he had heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of boys getting their arms and legs broken playing
football!</p>

<p>Kendall’s mother, however, wrote a letter full
of sympathy for Kendall and indignation at Mr.
Collins. That letter was like a pat on the back.
The only unsatisfactory part of it was where Mrs.
Burtis said she didn’t see why Kendall needed to
have shielded those bad boys who really merited
the punishment. Kendall was for a moment disappointed
in his mother. But he presently
“guessed that a woman doesn’t look at those
things in quite the way a man does,” and viewed
her more leniently. When he replied he explained
at great length that it would have been
a most dishonorable action to have revealed the
identity of the Broadwood fellows, and hinted
that nothing short of boiling oil or melted lead
would ever induce him to speak. Then he struck
the pose of a martyr for a page or so and inscribed
himself “Your loving son, Kendall.”</p>

<p>But these letters and replies came later, and we
are getting ahead of our story.</p>

<p>As Mr. Collins had suggested, there was no reason
why Kendall’s schoolmates should know of
his probation, and so Kendall kept the knowledge
to himself. There were times when the temptation
to tell Harold was strong, times when Kendall
felt the need of talking it over with somebody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and getting sympathy. But Harold was not
what Kendall called a very sympathetic soul, and
so the secret was kept. At the end of two or
three days the incident of the green paint ceased
to interest the school and for the present it remained
a mystery. Other things happened to
engage the attention of the fellows. There was
first scrimmage one Thursday afternoon, when
they were allowed to get for the first time some
idea of what the line-up of the football team was
to be. And then, two days later, came the first
game of the schedule, a contest of four eight-minute
periods with Greenburg High School. It was
a warm afternoon and players and spectators
alike sweltered in the sun. Kendall witnessed his
first real game of football and found it interesting,
although as a matter of fact it was rather a
dull and loosely played contest. Neither team
had “got together” as yet, and fumbles, mixed
signals and other misplays were frequent on both
sides. Yardley took the lead in the second period
by seizing advantage of a Greenburg fumble on
the latter’s twenty yards and from there working
over the goal line for a touchdown from which
Wallace Hammel missed a try at goal by some
six yards. In the next period Greenburg tied the
score, missing an even easier goal, and in the last
period of play Stearns, right half-back, got away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
around Greenburg’s end for a sixty-yard run and
another score. Hammel again missed a goal and
the final score stood 10 to 5.</p>

<p>Nobody was unduly elated over the showing of
the Yardley team, although, as Tom Roeder
pointed out that evening when they were talking
it over in Dan’s room, they hadn’t done so badly
considering everything. “Look at the heat, Dan!
Thunder, I had a regular cascade running down
my back all the time! Bet you I lost five
pounds!”</p>

<p>“What did the scales say?” asked Arthur
Thompson, who, a new recruit that fall, was after
Roeder’s or Stearns’s position.</p>

<p>“Oh, they said a pound and four ounces,” replied
Tom carelessly. “But they were probably
mistaken!”</p>

<p>“Sandy Fogg played a dandy game at center,”
said Gerald.</p>

<p>“Good on defense,” agreed Dan, “but he was
mighty slow on getting into the attack.”</p>

<p>“He has too much fat on,” said Tom. “Or he
did have before we began playing. I guess he’s
some lighter now.”</p>

<p>“What the dickens was the matter with Wallace
Hammel?” asked Arthur. Tom shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>“Search me. Both those goals were easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
enough, and he had all the time he wanted. He’s
feeling rather rotten about it to-night; peevish as
you please; I simply had to get out of the room.”</p>

<p>“He will come around all right after awhile,”
said Dan. “But I certainly wish we had two or
three good drop-kickers.”</p>

<p>“Simms did pretty good work last year,” suggested
Arthur.</p>

<p>“Simms had a record of five goals last season,”
replied Dan, “out of about sixteen chances.
What we need is a fellow we can depend on. We
need better punters than we’ve got, too. Ridge
is fair, but if he gets put out of a game it’s up
to Wallace or me, and we’re neither of us much
good. Payson says he’s going to find some kickers
if he has to go over the school with a fine-tooth
comb, but I don’t know where he’s going
to get them.”</p>

<p>“The trouble is,” said Tom, “that you can’t
develop good punters and drop-kickers in a season,
and those we had all graduated. We’re going
to miss Loring like anything. He was a born
punter, Alf was.”</p>

<p>“He was a born everything in the football
line,” said Arthur.</p>

<p>“I wish he had his job back again,” sighed
Dan.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you who was the dandy kicker,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Tom, “and that’s Kapenhysen, Dan. Remember
how he used to send ’em off?”</p>

<p>“I sure do. I wish I could get him back here
this fall to take charge of the punters. I believe
I’ll write and ask him.”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t come, I guess,” said Tom. “He’s
on the Yale Varsity this year.”</p>

<p>“I know, but he might get away for a week
just before the Broadwood game and put the finishing
touches on for us. I don’t believe Kap
will make the first team this season, Tom; he’s
got too many good men to beat.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not. Better ask him, anyhow. By
the way, Gerald, I thought you were going to play
this fall.”</p>

<p>“I thought so, too, but Dan wouldn’t let me.”</p>

<p>“He’s still trying to boss you? Kick him
in the shins, Gerald. Why won’t he let you?”</p>

<p>“Because,” replied Dan, “Mr. Pennimore is on
the Cross-Country Team and they need his services
more than we do.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know, Dan,” laughed Gerald. “I
may have the making of a great football player
in me.”</p>

<p>“Better stick to your trade, though,” said
Tom. “How’s the Cross-Country Team coming
on?”</p>

<p>“Hard at it every afternoon now,” Gerald answered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
“We’ve got a dandy string of runners
this year, fellows. Broadwood won’t have a
look-in.”</p>

<p>“Larry Goodyear’s captain, isn’t he?” asked
Arthur.</p>

<p>“Yes. He wants to get Nordham to come in
and make it a three-cornered race this year. I
wish she would.”</p>

<p>“Won’t she?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“I don’t know yet. They haven’t answered
Goodyear’s letter. Say, Arthur, Harry’s doing
pretty well. I suppose he told you he finished
eighth yesterday?”</p>

<p>“He said something like that but I didn’t believe
him.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Harry?” inquired Tom.</p>

<p>“Young Merrow, Arthur’s roommate and
fidus,” Dan replied.</p>

<p>“Fido would be better,” laughed Gerald.
“He’s always at Arthur’s heels. I’ll bet you
persuaded him to try for the Cross-Country Team,
Arthur, so you could get away from him a
minute.”</p>

<p>“You guessed it, son. I’m going over to Oxford.
Anyone coming my way?”</p>

<p>Tom Roeder decided that his path led in that
direction and the two boys departed together.
After they had gone Dan asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you mean that about young Merrow, Gerald?
I thought he was a bit of a duffer.”</p>

<p>“He was. Arthur used to have to drive him
out of the room every afternoon to make him take
exercise. But Arthur seems to have knocked
some sense into him somehow. I was awfully
surprised last week when I found him out for
the Cross-Country Team. He told me yesterday
that he’d never done anything but play a little
tennis, but he’s taken hold in good shape.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” observed Dan, “that Merrow is
Arthur’s penalty for heroism.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Ever since Arthur pulled
Harry out of the lake that time Harry’s stuck
to him like a brother.”</p>

<p>“You had a hand in it, too. It’s lucky he didn’t
decide to stick to you instead of Arthur. By the
way, speaking of protégés, your friend down the
hall has got tired, I notice.”</p>

<p>“Who is that, Dan? Oh, I remember. You
mean he’s given up football?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was looking over the list this afternoon
and saw his name scratched off. Cowles
says he’s stopped coming. Another ‘natural-born
player’ gone wrong.”</p>

<p>“That’s rather funny. I told you, didn’t I, that
I had him in one afternoon? He seemed—well,
not the sort of fellow to quit. I meant to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
him up again. I rather liked him. But this cross-country
work has kept me busy. Did he show
anything in practice?”</p>

<p>“N-no, I believe not. I think you prophesied
quite a career for him, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I said maybe,” laughed Gerald. “There was
something about the chap that made me—sort of
believe in him.”</p>

<p>“I remember there was something,” Dan
agreed. “Well, he will probably find himself in
the course of time. Evidently football isn’t what
he was looking for. Perhaps it’s just as well
he dropped out, though, for the first cut comes
next week and I guess most of Holmes’s ‘rookies’
will retire to private life.”</p>

<p>“What does Payson think of the outlook,
Dan?”</p>

<p>“Says it’s an average one. There’s no one
very startling in sight. That rather pleases Payson,
though; you know he doesn’t fancy ‘stars.’
Says he’d rather have a team of common or garden
variety of peggers.”</p>

<p>“I thought Billy Norton was considered a
‘star,’” said Gerald with a smile.</p>

<p>“He is—by Billy Norton,” replied Dan dryly.
“He’s a star that will suffer eclipse if he doesn’t
get down out of the clouds and play the game.
Sayer is hot after him these days.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sayer,” mused Gerald. “Yes, he was rather
good last year in the Porter game. Let’s see,
we dropped Porter this year, didn’t we?”</p>

<p>“Porter? No, we dropped Brewer. We have
seven games instead of eight. Seven’s enough,
too. Well, let’s go over to Cambridge and see
what’s doing. I haven’t been near it yet.”</p>

<p>Cambridge and Oxford were the two school societies,
with rooms on the top floor of Oxford
Hall. On their way down the stairs they met a
boy coming up. Gerald nudged Dan.</p>

<p>“Here he is now,” he whispered.</p>

<p>The boy was Kendall, and as he reached the
others he glanced up, said “How do you do?”
and would have gone by had not Gerald spoken.</p>

<p>“How are you getting on?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Pretty well, thanks.” Kendall paused on the
step above.</p>

<p>“How’s football coming?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“Not very well. I gave it up.”</p>

<p>“That so? I’m sorry. What was the trouble?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much. I—I just thought I’d better.”</p>

<p>Dan smiled and nodded and started on, but
Gerald, yielding to a sudden impulse, said: “I
thought you were coming to see me, Burtis. Drop
in some evening. I’m not in much in the afternoon
now. Will you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thanks, I—I’d like to.”</p>

<p>“Good stuff! Don’t forget, then.”</p>

<p>At the doorway Dan turned with a quizzical
smile. “Why?” he asked.</p>

<p>Gerald looked puzzled and shook his head. “I
don’t know. But there’s something about him
that—interests me. I don’t know—”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s his hair,” chuckled Dan. “There’s
plenty of it.”</p>

<p>“I must get him to have it cut,” replied Gerald
soberly. Then after a moment, he exclaimed
triumphantly: “I know what it is!”</p>

<p>“What what is?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“It’s his mouth, Dan. Ever notice it? It’s
always on the point of laughing and it never does
it. I want to see him laugh!”</p>

<p>“You’re a queer duffer,” Dan answered with
amusement as they entered Oxford. “I believe
Curtis, or whatever his name is, has hypnotized
you!”</p>

<small>NEW ACQUAINTANCES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Probation didn’t weigh as heavily on Kendall
as he had thought it was going to. It
was hard at first to reconcile himself to
giving up the football career he had dreamed of
for two years, or, rather, since he meant to try
again as soon as he might, to postponing it. But
after a week or so the first sting of disappointment
passed. At least, he was not barred from
watching practice, even if he couldn’t take part
in it. As for the Saturday afternoon games, he
missed none of them. And when, on the thirteenth
of October, St. John’s Academy played
Yardley to no score game Kendall was as bitterly
disgruntled as anyone. The plain truth of
the matter was that Yardley should have won that
contest by two scores. That she didn’t was due
to two things: Wallace Hammel’s inability to kick
a field goal from the twenty-five yard line and
Simms’s headless generalship when, in the third
period, Yardley had the ball on St. John’s twelve
yards on a first down. Dan was not playing. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
he had been Simms’s signal for a forward pass
would have been countermanded. The quarter-back
got the throw off in good style, but Norton,
who was to have taken it, ran too far across the
field and the ball went into the eager arms of a
St. John’s player who romped half the length of
the field with it before Simms, striving heroically
to avert the consequences of his error of judgment,
brought him down from behind. After that
Holmes was sent in at quarter with instructions
to pound at the opponent’s line for a touchdown.
But St. John’s managed to stave off defeat until
the final whistle came to her rescue, and went
home proud and elated.</p>

<p>Yes, even Kendall, who had had scant opportunity
to study the strategy of the game, saw
where the trouble lay and groaned impotently
more than once as Yardley’s chances of victory
were thrown away. What especially surprised
him was Hammel’s failure to kick that goal. The
pass from Fogg, who played center, was perfect,
the dark blue line held like a wall and he had all
the time in the world. And yet the ball missed the
left upright by a good six feet. Why, Kendall
was almost certain that he could have done better
than that himself, although he had never tried to
drop-kick a goal! He wondered on the way up
the hill if anyone would object if he brought his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
football down there some morning between recitations
and tried a few goals. He didn’t believe
they would. He made up his mind to do it.</p>

<p>And so on Monday morning, after mathematics,
he hurried to his room, got his old stained and
frayed pigskin and went down to the gridiron.
There was not a soul in sight at that time of day.
It had rained in the night and the ground was
soft and slippery. Kendall started at the fifteen
yards and missed the crossbar by five feet or so.
At twenty yards he got over once and missed
twice. It wasn’t as easy as it had looked. At
twenty-five yards, however, he had less difficulty.
Ten tries netted him six goals, which wasn’t so
bad considering that Kendall hadn’t kicked a
football for a month or more.</p>

<p>After that he took the ball to the side of the
field and tried angles. Naturally, he wasn’t
overly successful at this, but he managed several
times to get the pigskin across the bar, and he
became so interested that he quite lost track of
time and the hour bell found him far from Oxford
and he had to hide the football in a corner of
the tennis shed and sprint all the way up the
hill.</p>

<p>He was back again the next morning, and several
other mornings that followed and, although
there was none to watch or applaud, he didn’t get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
tired of conquering the crossbar with the dirty
old brown ball. When, one day he managed to
put it over from placement squarely on the
thirty-five yard line he was very well pleased indeed.
Place-kicking was something he had known
nothing of before coming to Yardley, and he had
to solve its problems unaided. But solve them
he did. He learned to judge the strength of the
wind and allow for it, to point the ball according
to distance and direction, to keep his eye on the
spot to be kicked. Doubtless he would have progressed
more rapidly with someone to teach him,
but he got along remarkably well alone. An expert
would have instructed him to have the laced
side of the ball toward him so as to use the lacings
as a guide in sighting, and Kendall had to discover
the advisability of that unaided. And so
the morning’s half hour of goal-kicking became
quite a regular event for Kendall, and almost
every day—always when the weather allowed—he
was down on the field after mathematics recitation
swinging that long right leg of his and
rapidly wearing the leather off the toe of his shoe.
And then one forenoon when he was trudging up
the hill with the pigskin tucked under his arm it
suddenly occurred to him that perhaps for almost
a fortnight he had been unintentionally disobeying
rules. That afternoon he sacrificed a quarter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of an hour of watching practice and found Mr.
Collins in the office.</p>

<p>“You know, sir,” explained Kendall, “you told
me I mustn’t take part in athletics, and I’ve been
practicing goal-kicking. Was that wrong, sir?”</p>

<p>“Hm,” said Mr. Collins, placing the tips of
his fingers together and frowning intently for a
moment. “Er—on your own hook, so to speak,
Burtis?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir. I just wanted to see if I could
do it.”</p>

<p>“Well, no, I don’t think you are guilty of any
wrong, my boy, for you say you didn’t think about
it. In fact, I’m not sure that what you’ve been
doing is an infringement of the rules. Still, I
think that, in order to be on the safe side, you
had better drop it. I’m sorry, but rules are rules,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Kendall with a sigh. Then,
after a moment’s hesitation, “Could you tell me,
Mr. Collins, how much longer probation is going
to last?” he asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Collins shook his head gently. “No, I
can’t. I don’t know, and it would be wrong to
tell you if I did. But I will say that you have
been doing very good work, Burtis, and I think
I may assure you that if you keep it up your term
of probation will terminate before very long.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir, thank you.”</p>

<p>“You’re very welcome. By the way, you
haven’t been to see me yet, have you? Or was
I out when you called?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would. What are you doing this
evening after supper? Couldn’t you drop down
and see me for a while? There’ll be one or two
other fellows there, probably. We have a sort
of a club on Friday nights. Just to talk things
over, you know, and exchange ideas. Perhaps
you may know the others; if not you’ll want to.
Better drop in for a while, Burtis.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir, I’d like to very much,” replied
Kendall gratefully.</p>

<p>And yet when the time came he felt rather shy
about it and it was nearly eight when he finally
descended the stairs and knocked at the door of
Mr. Collins’s study. It was the Assistant Principal’s
voice that bade him enter. The room was
very comfortable and homelike. The walls were
lined with bookshelves, there were many easy-chairs,
most of them turned toward the hearth
where the tiniest of soft coal fires was burning,
and the light was supplied by a squatty lamp on
the big table so shaded that the upper part of
the room was left in a mellow twilight. Mr. Collins’s
“one or two other fellows” were in reality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
five. As Kendall was introduced to them they
stood up and their faces were blurred in the pleasant
gloom. But two faces he recognized. One
belonged to Arthur Thompson and the other to
Cowles, the manager of the Football Team. The
remaining three boys, all First Class fellows,
were Tooker, Sanford and Abercrombie. Tooker
was short and round and smiling; Sanford, tall,
dark and earnest, and wore tortoise-shell spectacles
which gave him the appearance of a
benignant owl; Abercrombie was a small chap
with light hair and a high-pitched voice whose
somewhat buttonish nose was straddled by a pair
of glasses which were forever dropping off when
he talked and being dragged back at the end of
a length of black silk cord.</p>

<p>Everyone seemed very affable and gracious;
those within reach shook hands with a hearty
grip. Cowles recalled the fact that Kendall had
come out for football and mentioned it, asking
in the next breath why he had deserted them.
Luckily Kendall was spared an answer to this as
the tall and earnest Sanford was remarking that
he had once known a chap named Burtis in New
York.</p>

<p>“Maybe a relative of yours?” he queried.</p>

<p>Kendall, taking the deep chair pushed forward
by the host, expressed his doubts of that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“An odd name, though, if you don’t mind my
saying so,” continued Teller Sanford. “One
doesn’t encounter it often, I think.”</p>

<p>“Probably an accident,” remarked Ned Tooker.
“The name was Curtis, do you see, and the
printer got mixed and set up a B for a C. Simple
enough. Merely a typographical error.”</p>

<p>“It’s no funnier than your name, Ned,” observed
Arthur Thompson. “I suppose, by the
same token, your name was once Hooker?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Ned gravely, “it was formerly
Ted Nooker, but owing to an unfortunate habit
of mine—”</p>

<p>Everyone laughed, and Kendall, without knowing
what at, found himself laughing with the rest.
Ned waited gravely and continued:</p>

<p>“As I was saying, or about to say when so
rudely interrupted, owing to an unfortunate habit
I have of transposing the first letters of words it
became Ned Tooker. You get me, I trust, gentlemen?”</p>

<p>“We get you, Ned. It must be confusing, however,
for your folks.”</p>

<p>“It was at first. But I prevailed on the family
to adopt my version and now we’re all Tookers.
Of course, it <em>took us</em> some time to get—”</p>

<p>But he was drowned in a howl of agony.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gaddis told us in class last year,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Abercrombie, dropping his glasses from his nose
and rescuing them, “that the pun was the lowest
form of humor. I agree with him.”</p>

<p>Ned Tooker bowed deeply. “I shall inform him
of your agreement, Mr. Abercrombie. He will be
glad to learn it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why people are so down on puns,”
said Cowles stoutly. “I’ve heard some mighty
good ones.”</p>

<p>“As far as I am concerned,” said Mr. Collins,
“I think a good pun is just as funny as any other
form of humor. Sometimes I conclude that persons
who frown on punning—and I’m not referring
to Mr. Gaddis—are incapable of doing it.
The pun has its place. Dr. Holmes, if you recollect,
remarks that the pun can claim the parentage
of Homer. Doubtless you can all recall
instances when that worthy gentleman has descended—or
arisen, all according to the point of
view—to paronomasia.”</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, sir?” exclaimed Ned Tooker.</p>

<p>Mr. Collins laughed. “Paronomasia, Tooker;
that’s the scientific term for it.”</p>

<p>“Sounds like a disease,” observed Sanford.</p>

<p>“I’ve known cases where it amounted to that,”
replied Mr. Collins. “And speaking of Oliver
Wendell Holmes, the good doctor was very fond
of punning, and some he perpetrated are pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
bad. In one place among his verses you’ll find
the following:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘Hard is the job to launch the dangerous pun,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A <em>pun</em>-job dangerous as the Indian one.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">That seems to show a good deal of effort, and I
take it that a pun should be launched on the spur
of the moment. A studied pun is heavy, and a
heavy joke is as bad as a heavy biscuit.”</p>

<p>“I remember reading somewhere once,” said
Cowles, “about a fellow who was challenged to
find a pun for Mephistopheles. He replied that
it was a hard thing for a man to do, but that he
‘May if he’s tough, Elise.’”</p>

<p>“Wow!” exclaimed Tooker. “Did they slay
him?”</p>

<p>“History doesn’t record,” Cowles acknowledged.</p>

<p>“Talking about names,” said Sanford, “I think
one of the oddest I ever heard was Sauerpickle.”</p>

<p>“There’s a fellow in our town named Twelvetrees,”
offered Arthur Thompson.</p>

<p>“When I was a boy,” said Mr. Collins, “my
mother, I recall, used to tell of an old lady whose
name was Hepzibah Gandel. That has always
seemed to me about as odd a name as there is.”</p>

<p>“There’s an old man who lives near us,” hazarded
Kendall, “whose name is Meshach Fish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not bad,” drawled Tooker judicially. “Reminds
me of my friend Shadrach Rowe. They
called him Shad Rowe for short.”</p>

<p>“Ned, that will be about all from you,” laughed
Arthur.</p>

<p>“You don’t believe it?” protested Tooker.
“Why, the man’s a prominent citizen of my town;
keeps a shoot and boe store—”</p>

<p>There was a laugh at that. Tooker waited patiently
and resumed. “He doesn’t mind being
called Shad; makes no bones about it!”</p>

<p>The talk became more serious after that, and
the subjects ran all the way from Football to
Elective Courses. At nine o’clock Mr. Collins disappeared
and returned presently with a tall
pitcher of lemonade and a tin box of biscuits. The
conversation again became jocular, Tooker starting
it with:</p>

<p>“Well, Teller, I was right after all, wasn’t I?”</p>

<p>“About what?” asked Sanford gravely.</p>

<p>“About the lemonade,” replied Tooker with the
straightest of faces. “You said you didn’t think
Mr. Collins would give us lemonade to-night and
guessed you wouldn’t come. I told you he would,
though!”</p>

<p>Sanford’s shocked denials were drowned in the
laughter of the rest, from which Tooker’s voice
emerged again:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“—Very wrong, I think, to consider your stomach
as much as you do, Teller. I’ll have another
biscuit, please, Arthur.”</p>

<p>Kendall found Ned Tooker fascinatingly amusing.
Kendall was not much of a joker himself, but
he was blessed with a generous sense of humor
and he enjoyed Ned’s ridiculous remarks thoroughly.
Presently the little gathering broke up,
Tooker tugging at Sanford’s sleeve with one hand
and exhibiting the empty pitcher with the other:</p>

<p>“Come on, Teller, it’s all gone; honest; look for
yourself.”</p>

<p>Sanford informed him that he was a “silly
ass.”</p>

<p>“I deny it,” replied Ned. “I may lack tact, but
I’m not an ass. Good night, Mr. Collins.”</p>

<p>“Good night,” laughed the host. “Come again,
fellows.”</p>

<p>“Coming along, Ned?” called Abercrombie from
the entrance.</p>

<p>“No, I’m going home with this chap. I want
to hear more about his friend Meshach Fish.”
The others laughed and went out and Ned turned
to Kendall. “Mind if I go up with you and converse
awhile? Those fellows are so flippant that
I really feel the need of a few moments of serious
conversation to compose my mind.”</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">Kendall, striving to hide his surprise, replied
that he would be very glad to have
Tooker come up.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied Ned, leading the way.
“You’re in 21, aren’t you? I used to be in 17
myself last year.”</p>

<p>“What made you leave?” asked Kendall politely.</p>

<p>“Custom, Burtis, custom. We’re all slaves to
it. In your senior year you have the inestimable
privilege of rooming in Dudley. It’s always done
and so I did it. Left a perfectly comfortable,
well-heated room and went over there to freeze
in a little two-by-twice hole-in-the-wall. Here we
are! Sure you don’t mind my sticking around
awhile?”</p>

<p>“Glad to have you,” replied Kendall, observing
with satisfaction that Harold was out. “That big
chair’s the most comfortable.”</p>

<p>But Tooker chose a straight-backed chair, explaining
gravely that he believed in mortifying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
flesh whenever possible. He took up a book,
glanced at the title and laid it down again:</p>

<p>“Mayne Reid. I never read him. Is he good?”</p>

<p>“That’s not mine; it’s Towne’s.”</p>

<p>“Towne? Harold Towne?”</p>

<p>Kendall nodded. Ned reached a hand across the
table to him. Kendall, at a loss, took it, and Ned
gave him a long, hard pressure.</p>

<p>“My poor boy,” he sobbed, “my poor, poor
boy!”</p>

<p>Then he dropped Kendall’s hand, placed his
own hands behind his head, leaned back in his
chair and surveyed the room.</p>

<p>“Quite chaste,” he murmured. “I recognize
some of the works of art. That chromo effect over
there used to belong to Steve Woods when I was
a boy here. And, yes, methinks yon cast-steel engraving
was once in my own abode. I sold it to
Gus Cooke for fifty cents. We were never friends
afterwards. I suspect Gus changed quarters to
get away from it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s so bad,” said Kendall.</p>

<p>“You don’t—at first. It’s a peculiar picture,
that one. I recall that I really liked it myself at
first. Then it became a—a sort of nightmare.
Well, never mind the picture. Tell me, what are
you doing here, Burtis?”</p>

<p>“Doing here?” repeated Kendall puzzledly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, what is your Great Object? Some of us,
you know, come to study our way into college,
some of us come to meet fellows who will be
useful to us in later life, some of us come to play
football or baseball and some of us—some few of
us, Burtis,—come to Uplift and Better our Fellow
Beings.”</p>

<p>“I guess I just came to learn things,” answered
Kendall with a smile. “What did you come for?”</p>

<p>“To Uplift and Better,” responded Ned sadly.
“It has been a hard task, however. Still, I have
done some good, I have had my victories, Burtis.
You should have known Teller Sanford before I
took him in hand. It was pitiful, absolutely
pitiful.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Kendall, not knowing whether
the other was in jest or earnest.</p>

<p>“No sense of humor at all,” replied Ned confidentially.
“Intense! Serious! Heavy! Oh, I
don’t pretend that he is completely reclaimed yet,
but there’s a big improvement. Everyone says
so. It takes time.”</p>

<p>“Do you room with him?” asked Kendall.</p>

<p>“Yes. It was the only way. Constant association,
you know.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Kendall soberly. Ned smiled.
Then,</p>

<p>“Do you know, Burtis, I like you,” he exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
approvingly. “You have a sense of humor. One
wouldn’t suspect it, though. You’re such a serious-looking
chap until that smile gets in its work
around your mouth. I daresay that’s the New
England of it. New Englanders hate to smile if
they can get out of it any way, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“Do they?” asked Kendall. “I never thought
that. Where do you live?”</p>

<p>“Me? Oh, I’m one of ’em; that’s how I know.
I live in a little town called Boston. Some of my
folks founded the place, I believe. You come from
Maine, I think Mr. Collins said. How do you like
our school?”</p>

<p>“Very much, only—”</p>

<p>“Only?” prompted Ned.</p>

<p>Afterwards Kendall was very much surprised
at himself, but now there was something about
the caller that loosed Kendall’s tongue, and almost
before he knew it he had confided the fact
that he was on probation. Ned Tooker whistled
softly. Then he smiled.</p>

<p>“Burtis—by the way, what did you say your
first name was when you asked me to call you by
it?”</p>

<p>“Kendall,” laughed the other.</p>

<p>“Great!” exclaimed Ned. “Why don’t you do
it oftener?”</p>

<p>“Do what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“Laugh. It’s very becoming.”</p>

<p>“Why, I—I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you do; it’s because you’re a New Englander.
You ought to practice laughing. I had
to. Now I can do it almost without an effort.
Where were we? Oh, yes, you said your name was
Kendall. That’s a good name, Bendall Kurtis.
Mine’s Ted Nook—no, I mean Ned Tooker. Call
me Ned. I foresee that we’re going to be pals,
Curt.”</p>

<p>Kendall tried to think of something to say, and
Ned came to his rescue:</p>

<p>“I know what you’re thinking. You’re thinking
that I’m too blamed friendly. Oh, yes, you
are! But don’t let it worry you. I used to be
like you before I threw off the shackles of New
England reserve. If I liked a fellow I threw
bricks at him. Now if I like him I say so right
out in my engaging manner and it saves time.
But you haven’t told me yet what you did to get
the Office down on you.”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t believe I can,” said Kendall. “It
isn’t my secret alone, you see.”</p>

<p>“Dine and fandy!” cried Ned. “Curt, I love
you! You not only have a sense of humor, but
you possess a Great Secret. I’m positively daffy
about secrets. Keep it to yourself as long as you
can, but I give you fair warning that I’ll have it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
out of you sooner or later. I shall live for nothing
else, Curt!”</p>

<p>“Why do you call me Curt?” asked Kendall.</p>

<p>“Why not? Your name is Bendall Kurtis—”</p>

<p>“It’s Kendall Burtis,” answered the other with
a smile.</p>

<p>“I can’t say that. To me you are Bendall Kurtis;
Curt for short; short and curt. What’s that
I see? A football?”</p>

<p>Kendall acknowledged that it was.</p>

<p>“Oh, do you play?”</p>

<p>“I was trying to when—”</p>

<p>“When the sword fell. Football’s a good game.
I’ve sometimes thought I had the making of a
good player.”</p>

<p>“Have you never tried?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, many times, but the coaches didn’t
share my estimate of my ability. Nowadays I’m
reduced to golf—and a little tennis.”</p>

<p>“I’ve never seen anyone play golf,” admitted
Kendall.</p>

<p>“You shall. Not only that, Curt, but I’ll make
a golfer of you. I’ll teach you the game. What
are you doing to-morrow? No, there’s a football
game to-morrow. Then Monday?”</p>

<p>“Why—why, nothing.”</p>

<p>“First lesson at four promptly. You have no
clubs, I suppose. Naturally you wouldn’t have.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Very stupid of you, Ned. I’ll supply those necessary
utensils.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I could ever learn,” said Kendall
doubtfully. “You hit a ball around with a
stick, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Poetically put, my boy! You hit a ball around
with a stick! You shall see for yourself.” He
drew out a handsome gold watch, looked at it and
raised his eyebrows in surprise. “I must run
along home. Have you a clean collar?”</p>

<p>“Why, why, yes,” faltered Kendall.</p>

<p>“Let’s see it. Thank you.” Ned accepted it,
drew a pencil from his pocket and wrote on the
immaculate linen, “2 Dudley.” Then he hung the
collar over a corner of the mirror. “There, that’s
my address, Curt. Come often. I want you to
know Teller better. Besides, I believe you can be
of help to me in his education. Good night.”</p>

<p>“Good night,” said Kendall. “Thank you.”</p>

<p>Ned slammed the door behind him, and then,
opening it again, he stuck his head back into the
room.</p>

<p>“Enjoyed hearing you talk so much,” he said
with a grin.</p>

<p>Kendall heard Ned go down the stairs whistling
loudly. Then he turned, looked at the collar hanging
on the mirror and sat down on the edge of
his bed and dazedly tried to think it all out.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<small>THE MYSTERIOUS KICKER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">What puzzled Kendall was why Ned Tooker
had gone out of his way to be nice to him.
Of course it was plainly to be seen that
Ned was a creature of impulse, one who did about
what came into his head, but, allowing all that, it
wasn’t quite explained. Kendall was not impulsive
himself, and while he had a strong capacity
for affection, it was not his way to form
friendships very readily. This made Ned Tooker’s
behavior all the more strange to Kendall.
Perhaps it had been just an evening’s prank, a
means to pass an hour before bedtime, and perhaps
Ned would have forgotten all about it to-morrow.
But there was the promise to teach him
golf, and, still more tangible evidence, there was
one of Kendall’s lamentably few clean collars
curled about the mirror-post and bearing the
scrawling legend in the blackest of soft pencil
marks, “2 Dudley.” Kendall put aside the problem
for the moment with a sigh of despair and
got ready for bed. But he hoped that Ned had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
been sincere, for the older boy had quite won
Kendall’s heart.</p>

<p>If Kendall had known of a conversation which
passed in Mr. Collins’s study that evening Ned’s
sudden attachment would have been more understandable.
Mr. Collins had asked Ned to come
early as he had something to say to him, and Ned
had arrived ten minutes before any of the others.
Mr. Collins was standing in front of the little coal
fire and Ned had shaken hands with him ceremoniously,
a performance he always went through with
on such occasions.</p>

<p>“Good evening, sir,” said Ned. “I trust I find
you in good health.”</p>

<p>Mr. Collins replied that he was in the best of
condition. Then Ned proceeded to hand an imaginary
cane to an imaginary servant, draw off
two imaginary gloves which in imagination followed
the cane, remove an imaginary top hat
with an air and finally, with a hitch of his shoulders,
allowed the imaginary servant to remove
an imaginary Inverness cape. It was a very
clever bit of pantomime and never failed of applause.
To-night Mr. Collins laughed appreciatively,
laid a hand on Ned’s shoulder and drew him
to the fire:</p>

<p>“Well, everything all right, Tooker? The Optimist
Society making converts?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“Turning ’em away, sir, at every performance.”</p>

<p>“Good. I’ve got a new recruit for you, or perhaps
it would be better to say a new subject for
you.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir. Who is it?”</p>

<p>“A fellow named Burtis, a new boy this fall.
He rooms upstairs here in Number 21. I think
you’ll like him. I do. He seems to have more
than the usual amount of common sense, for one
thing. And he has principles. I believe, Tooker,
that he’s the sort we like, you and I; the sort that
becomes a credit to the school. But he needs a
little help right now. I can’t go into particulars,
but Burtis hasn’t been altogether fortunate since
he came. I think he’s a bit down-in-the-mouth
just now and he needs some fellow to chum up
to him a bit. I’ve asked him here this evening
and I want you to look him over and, if you possibly
can, get acquainted with him and tide him
over the next month or so. You’re the man for
the job, Tooker. Will you take it?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, sir. You’ll see us to-morrow
wandering away to the woods arm in arm, to carve
our initials on the tree trunks. Fever near, sir!”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” replied Mr. Collins with a smile.
“I’ll leave him to you, Tooker. By the way, I
neglected to say that Burtis is not yet—er—what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
we might call a tasteful dresser. There remains
about him a strong suggestion of the—er—bucolic.”</p>

<p>Ned shook his head. “I’ve never had that,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Had what?”</p>

<p>“The bucolic. Is it catching?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” Mr. Collins laughed. “And,
anyhow, Tooker, I don’t believe it could ever catch
you!”</p>

<p>And so during the evening Ned had been studying
Kendall most of the time, even when it seemed
that he hadn’t a thought beyond creating a laugh.
And what he had seen he had liked. He hadn’t
been surprised, for he had found that Mr. Collins’s
judgment in such matters usually coincided
with his. Ned’s verdict by the time the group
broke up was something like this: “Rather homely
in a nice way. Good eyes and looks straight at
you. Well-behaved. Rather shy. Doesn’t butt
in. Sees a joke before it knocks him down. Has
a good voice. Dresses like a farmer and needs
a hair-cut and a manicure, but looks as though he
knew the use of bath-tubs. On the whole an interesting
subject. Get busy.”</p>

<p>And he had got busy, with what results we
know. If there was some measure of duplicity in
Ned’s first evidences of interest and friendship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the duplicity was in a good cause. Before he had
taken himself away, however, Ned had ceased to
play a part, and his disconcerting “Do you know,
Burtis, I like you!” had been very genuine. But
on the way back to his room Ned had owned to
himself that it might not prove an easy task to
convert the outward appearance of his new protégé
to Yardley standards.</p>

<p>“He must have some other clothes,” murmured
Ned as he crossed the Yard to Dudley. “And first
of all he must have his hair cut. The hair-cut
won’t be difficult, but it’s a mighty delicate matter
to tell a chap that his clothes aren’t right.
Well, I’ll go at it gently. Tact, Ned, tact and
diplomacy!”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” he reflected after he was in bed and
listening to the musical efforts of his slumbering
roommate, “I wonder what the dickens that kid
did to get probation! He doesn’t strike you as
much of a cut-up. I can’t just see him putting
a tack in Bertie’s chair!” (Bertie was Mr. Albert
Von Groll, Instructor in Modern Languages.)
“Besides, he said the secret concerned others. I
suppose that’s what Collins meant when he said
the chap hadn’t been altogether fortunate since
he came. I should say not! It’s going some to
get on probation within three weeks of the opening
of school! Well, I’ll look him up again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
to-morrow. I simply <em>must</em> know why he’s on
pro!”</p>

<p>Yardley played her third football game the next
afternoon. Her opponent was Forest Hill School.
Forest Hill was not considered very dangerous
and there was a rumor that Payson meant to put
in a team of substitutes in the last two periods.
Ned Tooker reached the field only a few minutes
before the time of starting the game and the two
teams were already running through signals and
punting. As he turned the corner and walked
along in front of the crowded stand many hails
reached him:</p>

<p>“Ned, come on up; here’s a seat!”</p>

<p>“Oh you Took! Come and sit in my lap, Ned!”</p>

<p>But Ned only waved and smiled and went on,
searching the stand with his gaze. It was not
until the whistle had sounded and Sandy Fogg
had lifted the ball from the tee with the toe of
his shoe that Ned found whom he was looking for.
Then he climbed the stairs, nodding and eluding
the detaining hands thrust toward him, and
crowded his way along one of the seats until he
reached Kendall. The latter, absorbed in the
game—the Forest Hill left half-back was charging
back up the field with the pigskin nestled in his
arm—hadn’t seen Ned’s approach, and when the
latter crowded down beside him and Kendall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
turned to see who it was the smile that came into
his face was well worth seeing.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he said rather shyly.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bendall Kurtis,” replied Ned. “How
are you to-day? Who’s going to win the game?
You’re a football sharp, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Why, we are, of course,” returned Kendall
confidently. “But I wish you had seen that Forest
Hill fellow run that ball back. He must have
made twenty yards!”</p>

<p>“Good stuff! Who’s playing for us?”</p>

<p>“Most of the regulars. Fogg’s at center, Ridge
and Merriwell are the guards, Jensen and Mitchell
tackles, Vinton and Norton ends, Roeder and
Stearns half-backs, Simms quarter, and the full-back
I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“That’s Marion. What’s the matter with Hammel,
I wonder? That isn’t Jensen at right tackle,
though, Curt; that’s Stark.”</p>

<p>“Is it? But it looks like Jensen. No, he’s got
dark hair, hasn’t he? And there’s Jensen on the
bench down there; next to Holmes.”</p>

<p>“Jensen’s hair, by the way, is about the same
color as yours, Curt. I don’t like to see them wear
it as long as that, though. Nowadays, when headguards
are the fashion it isn’t necessary.” Ned
glanced at Kendall’s hair and displayed much embarrassment.
“I didn’t mean— Honest, Curt, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
hadn’t— You wear yours long, too, don’t you?”
he ended lamely.</p>

<p>“Me? Why, no; at least, not like Jensen’s. I
guess mine needs trimming.” Kendall laughed.
“Mother’s always after me to have my hair cut,
and now that I’m away from home I guess it’ll
be down on my shoulders if I don’t watch out.
It grows awfully fast.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t wear it long because you’re a
footballist?” asked Ned. “I’m glad of it, because
you’ll look better when it’s trimmed a little.
I’ve got to have mine done, too. We might
go through the agony together next week, eh?
Hello, look at that for a punt!”</p>

<p>“A dandy!” sighed Kendall. “Simms has got
it. No! Missed it! Got it again, though. He’s
down!”</p>

<p>“Now let’s see what our chaps can do with the
ball,” said Ned. “Here we go! Good work,
Roeder! Five yards easy! And right through
the center! Watch that Forest Hill left end, Curt.
He was off-side about a yard that time. There he
goes again. I thought so! Penalty for you, Mr.
Man!”</p>

<p>The whistle had blown and now the umpire was
carrying the ball five yards nearer the Forest
Hill goal.</p>

<p>“Now will you behave?” murmured Ned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
“This is a fake. Marion can’t punt. I thought
so. Stearns outside tackle for three yards. That
was very neat. Hello! What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>“Stearns fumbled,” said Kendall sadly. “It’s
Forest Hill’s ball.”</p>

<p>“And rather too near our goal to be comfortable.
About the thirty-five yard line, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” answered Kendall, sitting forward
on the edge of his seat. Three cheer leaders
jumped from their places and called for “A regular
cheer, fellows, and get into it!”</p>

<p>And then, while the cheer was crashing forth,
a brown-clad youth hurled himself against the
Yardley line, broke through, eluding player after
player, and circled toward the center of the field
and the Yardley goal. The watchers leaped to
their feet. Pandemonium reigned. Then Simms
dived for him and brought him fiercely to earth
on the twenty yards.</p>

<p>But it was first down again and only four white
lines separated the eager opponents from a touchdown.
The cheering began again, the leaders,
their commands drowned in the noise, waving
their arms in frantic encouragement. From
around Kendall and Ned cries of “<em>Hold</em> ’em!
<em>Hold</em> ’em!” arose and gathered rhythm and volume.
The Forest Hill quarter, hand to mouth,
was bellowing his signals. Then back went the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
ball, confusion reigned for a moment and another
scant two yards had been conquered.</p>

<p>“Right through Stark that time,” said Ned.
“I guess they’d better bring Jensen on. Second
down and eight to gain. Hold ’em, Yardley!”</p>

<p>But Yardley couldn’t, it seemed. What looked
like another plunge at the line resolved itself into
a delayed pass to left half, who tore along behind
the line, squirmed past Mitchell and got away
around the end for a good twelve yards. It was
first down again then, and Forest Hill, despite
the frenzied implorations of the Yardley supporters
and the best efforts of Yardley’s players,
gained the three yard line in two plays and
crashed through and over for the final distance
and a touchdown amidst the ecstatic cheers of
some twenty Forest Hill rooters. Unluckily for
the visitors they had secured their touchdown near
the side of the field and the subsequent punt-out
was lost. But five points looked pretty big at
that stage of the game and pessimists amongst
the audience were already predicting defeat for
the home team.</p>

<p>The first period ended after four more plays
and the teams donned blankets and rested. Then
the whistle blew again and the game went on.
Yardley pulled herself together then and managed
to stop the Forest Hill plunges, although the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
latter twice won her distance in that second
period. Once Yardley got to Forest Hill’s thirty
yards, but only to lose the ball on a fumble. The
second period ended with the score still five to
nothing and the two teams trotted off the field
and up the hill to the gymnasium.</p>

<p>A boy further along the row engaged Ned in
conversation, and Kendall, leaning back in his
seat, studied his new friend. Although Ned was
two years Kendall’s senior he was scarcely any
taller; there was perhaps the difference of an
inch between the two. Ned was fleshy without
being fat, carried himself very straight and had
a round, good-natured face from which a pair of
shrewd brown eyes twinkled. Kendall had already
learned that it was only by watching Ned’s
eyes that he could tell whether the latter was in
earnest or only joking, for Ned could, and did,
say the most outlandish things with the face of a
truthful undertaker. Ned always looked trim.
To-day he wore a suit of blue serge, a soft flannel
shirt of gray, a blue knitted silk tie, black socks
and rubber-soled tan Oxford shoes. And there
was a little gold pin in his tie, a plain seal ring
on one finger and from his watch dangled a leather
fob with a Yardley seal in silver and enamel.
Kendall mentally resolved to have one just like
it. He had seen them in a jeweler’s window in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Greenburg. And Kendall wondered why Ned’s
clothes fitted him so well, and why his lisle socks
showed never a hint of a wrinkle over his ankles.
Kendall knew that some persons had their clothes
made to order by tailors, and came to the conclusion
that Ned was one of these fortunate mortals,
a conclusion quite erroneous. Ned’s talk
with the other boy was all about golf, and much
of it Kendall couldn’t understand. When the
teams trotted back to the field and Ned settled
into his seat again Kendall asked:</p>

<p>“Are you at the head of the golf, Tooker?”</p>

<p>Ned looked amused. “I’m captain of the Golf
Team,” he explained. “We’ve got a five-man
match on with Broadwood here next Saturday.
That’s what Kirk was talking about. We’ve
never won a match from Broadwood yet, although
we’ve met them three times.”</p>

<p>“Why is that?” Kendall asked.</p>

<p>“We haven’t the players they have. As a matter
of fact, although it sounds like boasting, Curt,
I’m the only member of our team that has a show
with those chaps. Kirk isn’t bad, but he’s always
unlucky, and he’s been beaten every time. This
year he says he’s going to get revenge. He’s been
practicing every day except Sundays, I guess,
since school opened. Last spring he played a
dandy game but drew Frost, who is Broadwood’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
best player, and so didn’t have any show from
the start. By the way, don’t forget that you’re
coming out to learn the game Monday. There
goes the ball. Now, Yardley, get down to business.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the talk they had received from Payson
in the gymnasium helped. At all events,
Yardley’s players did get down to business, almost
with the sound of the whistle, and in the
ensuing ten minutes of playing time scored two
touchdowns. Hammel missed both goals. It was
Tom Roeder who proved the hero of that game.
Tom tore through the Forest Hill line for short
and steady gains that took the ball down the field
in short order. Once Stearns got loose for an end
run and once Simms worked a very pretty forward
pass to Dan, but for the most it was persistent
line-bucking that won the day.</p>

<p>In the fourth period, with the score 10 to 5,
Yardley sent in many substitutes, one of them
Arthur Thompson, who went in for Stearns.
Arthur did very well, especially on defense.
Holmes took Simms’s position at quarter-back
and ran the team in good shape. He was a gingery
chap, and, while he knew less football than
did Simms, and was a less spectacular player,
he got more speed from the team in spite of the
fact that, towards the last, it held six substitutes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Yardley added a third touchdown to her score
in the final minute of play, and Dan elected to
try the goal himself. The handful of Forest Hill
supporters jeered derisively as the ball left his
toe, for it was apparently much too low. But
some happy chance took it over the bar by an
inch or so—there were some who declared the ball
actually brushed the beam—and added another
point to the final score of 16 to 5.</p>

<p>On the whole the game had been encouraging
to Yardley’s hopes. Clearly outplayed in the first
period, the Blue had managed to hold her adversary
in the second and then, in the last two
periods, “come back” and rush Forest Hill off her
feet. It was what Ned, walking up the hill with
his arm linked in Kendall’s, called “a fine
recovery.”</p>

<p>Ned led Kendall across the Yard to Dudley and
down the corridor to Number 2. Sanford was
not at home. The room was small in comparison
with those in Clarke, but it was more comfortable
and had an open fireplace which Kendall envied
Ned the possession of. For a half hour Ned
showed golf clubs and explained their uses, told
stories of matches won or lost and managed to
get Kendall quite interested in the ancient and
royal game. He even illustrated strokes with his
clubs, to the imminent danger of the furniture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Then Kendall discovered a line of mugs on the
mantel and had to know about each. And about
that time Teller Sanford came in, and Kendall,
after a few moments, took himself off, Ned’s last
words being, “Don’t forget, Curt; Monday at half-past
three!”</p>

<p>There was a gathering of the talent in Number
28 Clarke that evening after supper; Tom Roeder,
Al Simms, Sandy Fogg, Arthur Thompson, Grafton
Holmes and, of course, Dan and Gerald. They
replayed the game, as boys will, and gave and
took criticism in good part. Neglected opportunities
were regretted, mistakes explained and
many “ifs” indulged in.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe,” said Sandy Fogg, the broad-shouldered,
good-natured center, “I ever played
in a game where there was less punting.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Dan. “It was ‘old-fashioned
football’ from start to finish. We should have
had another score, though. In the second period
we had a dandy chance down there on their thirty
yards.”</p>

<p>“That was me,” said Simms. “I don’t know
how it happened. Seemed as though that ball
just jumped away from me!”</p>

<p>“I don’t regret what didn’t happen so much
as what did,” observed Tom. “We ought never
to have let them get that touchdown.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Everyone assented more or less gloomily to
that.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” said Holmes cheerfully, “what’s
the good of post mortems? We beat ’em, and could
have done it again right afterwards. We were
slow in getting started, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“It won’t do to be so slow next Saturday,” said
Dan. “Carrel’s has a pretty good team this year,
I hear.”</p>

<p>“They’re light, though,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing we ought to find, Dan, if
you don’t mind my butting into your affairs,” said
Fogg, “and that’s some fellow who can kick a
goal once out of twenty times.”</p>

<p>“I know,” assented Dan with a frown. “And
don’t you think I’m not worrying about that as
much as you are, Sandy. We all thought last year
that Hammel was going to make good, but he
doesn’t seem to get down to it at all. Payson’s
going to have him out for morning practice next
week and says all he needs is a little more confidence.
I wish I’d let you try those goals this
afternoon, Al.”</p>

<p>But Simms shook his head. “I’m glad you
didn’t, Dan. I’d have slipped up sure on ’em. I
was so afraid you were going to, after that second
score, that I was afraid to look at you!”</p>

<p>“You should have put in the chap who was kicking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
goals down at the field one morning last
week,” said Arthur. “I watched him from the
window for about ten minutes and it looked as
though he couldn’t miss them.”</p>

<p>“Who was it?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I couldn’t make him out. One
of the subs, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Where was he kicking from?” asked Gerald.
“The five yard line?”</p>

<p>“About thirty, I think. And from an angle,
too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, Arthur,” laughed Dan, “you were
looking through one of those crazy panes of glass
in Oxford.”</p>

<p>“I was in Oxford, all right; Room C, it was; but
there wasn’t anything the matter with my eyesight.
I guess the fellow made ten or twelve tries
and kicked more than half as many goals.”</p>

<p>Dan glanced about the room questioningly.
“Who the dickens could it have been, fellows?”
he asked in perplexity. “I don’t know any sub
who can do that.”</p>

<p>“Or any regular, either,” murmured Tom.</p>

<p>“This was in the morning, you say?” asked
Sandy Fogg.</p>

<p>“Yes, just after my Latin. I was waiting for
some papers that Collins had.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t like to cast asparagus on your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
eyesight, Arthur,” said Tom, with a smile, “but
your story sounds fishy.”</p>

<p>“What was he kicking, Thompson, drop or
place?” asked Simms.</p>

<p>“Drop at first, and then he tried placement.”</p>

<p>“From the thirty yards?” asked Dan skeptically.</p>

<p>“Yes; certainly not nearer, Dan; I wouldn’t
swear it wasn’t nearer forty.”</p>

<p>“What did he look like? Had you ever seen
him before? Was he alone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he was all by his lonesome, and he looked
sort of tall; about your height, maybe. He had
his coat off and wore darkish clothes. That’s all
I could see.”</p>

<p>“But why the dickens didn’t you say something
about it? Have you seen him since?”</p>

<p>“No, but I haven’t looked for him. I didn’t
say anything about it because I forgot it. And,
anyway, I supposed you knew; thought you’d sent
him down there to practice.”</p>

<p>“I wish I did know! A chap who can kick
five goals out of ten would be a find. You’re not
joking, Arthur?”</p>

<p>“Of course I’m not,” responded Arthur impatiently.
“If you really don’t know who he is I
advise you to find him, for he certainly could kick
goals that day!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“You bet I’ll find him! I’ll find him if I have
to hire a regiment of detectives! Anyone guess
who he is?”</p>

<p>But they all shook their heads.</p>

<p>“The only explanation I can offer,” said Tom,
“is that Arthur went to sleep and dreamed it. I
don’t believe there’s a fellow in school who can
stand on the thirty yard line and drop-kick a goal
from an angle once out of two tries. Either you
were dreaming, Arthur, or what looked like goals
weren’t.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Dan. “At that distance it
would be hard to tell. Sometimes you’re mistaken
from the end of the field.”</p>

<p>“You fellows have it your own way,” said
Arthur with a sigh of resignation. “I know what
I saw.”</p>

<p>“Well, we will have to keep a lookout and see
if we can catch him at it again,” said Dan. “And,
for goodness’ sake, fellows, ask everyone you
know. If there really is a goal-kicker in our
midst we can surely find him.”</p>

<p>“Well, he will have to show me,” said Tom,
still unconvinced. “Look here, Arthur, it wasn’t
Wallace, was it?”</p>

<p>“No, I’d know Hammel a mile off. Besides, I
met and spoke to him ten minutes later in the corridor.
No, it wasn’t he.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s advertise,” suggested Holmes. “A notice
in Oxford might fetch him.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” Simms agreed. “‘If the student who
practiced goal-kicking on the field last week will
call on Dan Vinton he will hear of something to
his advantage.’ Something like that, eh?”</p>

<p>“I’ll try that if everything else fails,” said Dan
grimly. “A good drop- or place-kicker will be
worth about a million dollars to me this season.”</p>

<p>“We’ll find him all right,” said Fogg. “He’s
probably one of the subs who has discovered he
can kick and hasn’t the sense to say anything
about it.”</p>

<p>“As for me,” said Tom, “I’m like the countryman
at the menagerie when he saw the hippopotamus;
I don’t believe there’s no such critter!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>NED USES TACT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">On Monday Kendall took his first lesson in
golf. He appeared at Ned’s room wearing
his old brown sweater and a pair of heavy
shoes, one toe of which showed the effects of many
collisions with the football. Ned looked him over
and shook his head.</p>

<p>“You can’t do anything with that sweater,
Curt,” he said. “It binds your arms too much.
It isn’t cold to-day. Leave your sweater here.”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t any vest on!”</p>

<p>“You don’t need a vest. That’s it. Hello!
where’s your belt?”</p>

<p>“I wear suspenders,” Kendall replied.</p>

<p>“So I see. Take ’em off and I’ll find a belt for
you. Here’s one of Teller’s.”</p>

<p>“Won’t he mind my using it?” asked Kendall
doubtfully as he removed his suspenders.</p>

<p>“He will esteem it an honor,” answered Ned
gravely. “There you are. Slip your coat on
again. Isn’t that more comfortable? Now, about
shoes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“These are all right; they’re quite easy.”</p>

<p>“They look it! Never mind, I guess they’ll
have to do. I haven’t an extra pair. Now then,
come along.”</p>

<p>Kendall had hoped that they would find the
links deserted, since he didn’t at all fancy making
a public display of his awkwardness and ignorance,
but he was doomed to disappointment.
At least a half-dozen couples were making the
rounds, while four or five fellows were loitering
about the first tee. One of them was the boy who
had talked with Ned at the football game. He
was George Kirk, a good-looking Second Class
fellow. Kirk brandished a golf club and hailed
Ned with joy.</p>

<p>“Want to play a round, Ned?” he shouted as
they approached.</p>

<p>“Thanks, George, but I’m going to show Burtis
here something about the game. You fellows ever
met?”</p>

<p>They shook hands, Kirk very affably. He
showed no surprise at Ned’s announcement. In
fact, he felt none, for he had become quite used
to Ned’s vagaries.</p>

<p>“Mind if I go around with you?” he asked of
Kendall. Kendall hesitated and glanced at Ned.
The latter shook his head:</p>

<p>“Can’t have you, old man. This is Burtis’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
first lesson and he doesn’t want a gallery.
Where’s Morgan?”</p>

<p>“He’s over there with Jack Simpson. I
thought Wainwright might show up, but he hasn’t
come yet.”</p>

<p>“Pete’s gone to Greenburg to the dentist.
You’ll find someone, though. Come on, Curt.
Here’s a ball for you. And here’s a driver. It
is an old one of mine, but it’s a dandy.” He
made Ned’s tee for him, placed him in position
and pointed out the first hole. “Now then, just
swing your club back as though you didn’t care,
keep your eye on the ball and hit it.”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” muttered Kendall nervously, darting
a glance at the little audience who were watching
proceedings.</p>

<p>“Yes, you can. Now let me tell you something.
These fellows have all had to learn just as you’re
learning. You won’t do any worse than they did
the first time. Go ahead now. I don’t care where
the ball goes, only hit it. Easy back. That’s
right. Now down—”</p>

<p>Kendall’s driver swished through the air and
the ball, disturbed by the passing club, rolled off
the tee. Kendall smiled foolishly. The onlookers
smiled too, but more with Kendall than at him.
Ned picked up the ball and replaced it.</p>

<p>“All right. Try again. But don’t try to kill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
it, Curt. Just give it a nice little rap. And keep
your eyes on it all the time.”</p>

<p>Kendall, very flustered, raised his driver again,
swung down, dug the head of it in the earth some
four inches behind the ball.</p>

<p>“You weren’t looking at the ball,” said Ned severely.
“Once more now, and <em>keep your eyes on
the ball</em>.”</p>

<p>Perhaps it was only luck, but Kendall’s next
attempt resulted in a very clean forty-yard drive,
and the glow of satisfaction that came to him
more than atoned for what had gone before.</p>

<p>“Good stuff!” said Ned, and the others murmured
approval. Kendall tried to dissemble his
delight and drew aside to make room for Ned.</p>

<p>“Watch the way I do it,” said Ned. Kendall
watched, but it is doubtful if he learned much.
Ned’s club went back for a full swing, swished
down, there was a clean <em>click</em> and away sailed the
white ball high and far to drop safely over the
first bunker.</p>

<p>“Rotten!” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Not so bad; a little too high,” observed Kirk.
“Good luck, Burtis.”</p>

<p>Kendall followed Ned to where his ball had
fallen and Ned handed him a midiron.</p>

<p>“You’re going to play with three clubs until
you get the hang of it. This is a midiron, Curt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Now, as you haven’t any tee to help you get under
the ball, you’ve got to hit back of it; try to clip a
bit of the turf. And the swing is different. Let
me show you.” Ned illustrated. “Don’t try to
hit very hard; just try to put the ball up near
the bunker.”</p>

<p>“Is that mound the bunker?” asked Kendall.</p>

<p>“It is. Now see the way I swing this. Get it?
Keep that wrist stiff. No, you’re hunching up
your right shoulder. Don’t do that. And don’t
set your muscles all stiff like that. Relax!
That’s the stuff! Now then, have a shot.”</p>

<p>Kendall missed the ball entirely twice and finally
topped it so that it trickled along for about
twelve feet. The next time he buried the whole
head of his club six inches behind the ball and
looked up apologetically at Ned.</p>

<p>“I’m an awful duffer,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re learning the talk, anyway,”
laughed Ned. “We’re all awful duffers when we
start. Go ahead now. But try and keep your
eyes on the place you want to hit. That’s half
the secret of golf, Curt; <em>keep your eye on the
ball</em>. And it’s the hardest thing of all to learn.
See if you can’t give that a nice little rap that
will put it over the bunker.”</p>

<p>And Kendall did, and again the glow of satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
spread through him. He laughed nervously.</p>

<p>“I thought I was going to miss it entirely that
time,” he said. “But I did keep my eyes on the
ball, Tooker.”</p>

<p>“You sure did. But don’t call me Tooker. It’s
an awful name to have to listen to. Call me Ned.”</p>

<p>“You said the other night that your name was
Ted,” laughed Kendall.</p>

<p>“Ted, Ned or Ed; it doesn’t matter. Only
never Tooker. And now here’s a bit of information
for your future guidance. Never climb over
a bunker, Curt; it breaks it down. Further along
you will observe a nice little passage left for you;
see?”</p>

<p>Kendall saw and started for the break, supposing
that Ned was following. As he went through
he looked back. Ned was not there. Instead he
was in the act of jumping from the top of the
bunker.</p>

<p>“I thought you said I mustn’t do that,” said
Kendall.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t,” replied Ned gravely. “Ever.”</p>

<p>“But—why—you did it!”</p>

<p>“And so will you when you’ve played longer.
Now, then, you’re away.”</p>

<p>“I’m—what?” asked Kendall.</p>

<p>“Away; your ball’s farthest from the hole.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
That means that you play first. Give it a good
clean swipe this time.”</p>

<p>Kendall managed to send the ball some twenty
yards and looked at Ned for approbation. But
Ned shook his head.</p>

<p>“All wrong. You let your club slip in your
hands and you brought your shoulder up. Watch
this.”</p>

<p>Click! Away sailed Ned’s ball, straight and
low for the distant green. It struck, bounded and
rolled and finally trickled to within some six yards
of the flag. Kendall sighed. He had a lot to
learn, he feared, before he could ever equal that
performance. But he struggled on and finally
his ball lay almost beside Ned’s. Then he was
given another and quite different implement which
Ned explained was a putter. And now—luck
again very probably—Kendall distinguished himself
by holing out in some marvelous manner in
one!</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” breathed Ned softly.
It took him two to make the hole. “Four,” he
said. “That’s the best I’ve ever done this hole
in. That iron shot of mine was a dandy.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by ‘four’?” asked Kendall.</p>

<p>“Four strokes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, and what did I make?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think you were sixteen,” replied Ned carelessly.
“You did fairly well, Curt.”</p>

<p>Kendall thought a minute. Then, “Sixteen to
your four,” he murmured. “Say, Took—I mean
Ned—how many shots would I have taken if I’d
done poorly?”</p>

<p>Ned laughed. “You might have taken thirty,”
he answered. Then he clapped the disconsolate
Kendall on the back. “Cheer up, you’re doing
fine. It takes time and we’re all duffers at first.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll watch you for a while,” said Kendall
sadly.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll take this driver and come over
here and knock the spots off this ball,” answered
Ned. “And no mutiny, if you please, Mr. Bendall
Kurtis.”</p>

<p>“But—but it must be very tiresome for you,”
said Kendall.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about me. I’m as happy as
a clam as long as I can swing a golf club. Don’t
get discouraged, Curt. Remember that Bome
wasn’t ruilt in a day.”</p>

<p>“Remember what?” asked Kendall, puzzled.</p>

<p>“Why, that Rome wasn’t duilt in a bay,” answered
Ned. “Now then, here we go!”</p>

<p>They played five holes that afternoon, and after
that Ned made Kendall practice swinging his club
for ten minutes or so at the fifth tee. And then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
he made him drive several times, always patiently
correcting and explaining. When Kendall’s first
lesson in golf was finally over he went back to
Clarke with an unwonted aching in his arms and
shoulders. There was only one more lesson that
week, for Ned had to look after the work of the
Golf Team. But on Wednesday, Kendall did
rather better and was terribly proud and delighted.
Ned had insisted on Kendall’s using his
spare clubs and suggested that the novice could
learn a good deal by playing a few holes alone.
Kendall tried that on Thursday and did so poorly,
seeming to have lost what little science he had
attained, that he went home quite discouraged.
On Friday, Ned sought him after school and announced
that they were going to Greenburg to
have their hair cut.</p>

<p>“But I can’t go,” said Kendall. “I’m on probation,
you see.”</p>

<p>“I thought of that and so I saw Collins and
got permission for you to leave school for two
hours. Come on now.”</p>

<p>Ned’s hair didn’t really require trimming, but
he went through with it, and he was glad he had
afterwards, since by doing so he had brought
about the shearing of Kendall’s abundant locks.
Kendall looked at least twenty-five per cent. better
when he left the barber shop and Ned, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
courage had been failing him, took heart again.
“If,” he told himself, “a mere hair-cut will work
that improvement in him, what will a decent suit
of clothes do?”</p>

<p>They strolled along the street, looking in at
windows and enjoying themselves hugely, until
they reached Wallace’s. There Ned stood treat
to a wonderful concoction called a “maple-nut
sundae.” If you don’t think it was good, try it
yourself some time. It was vanilla ice cream with
chopped walnuts and maple sugar lavishly sprinkled
over the top of it. It was so good that Kendall
begged to be allowed to stand treat in turn,
and so they each had another glass of the delectable
mixture. Then Ned observed carelessly:</p>

<p>“I wonder if you’d mind walking down to the
New York Store with me, Curt?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. What sort of a place is it?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know it? It’s the best clothing
store here. I want to see what they’ve got there.
I’ll have to be buying a winter suit some day.”</p>

<p>Once inside, the rest was far easier than Ned
had dared hope. He had some ten or fifteen suits
produced for their inspection and asked Kendall’s
opinion and advice constantly. Then he “jollied”
the clerk until that young gentleman would have
pulled half the stock down for them. At last Ned
remarked casually:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“This wouldn’t be a bad chance for you to get
rigged out with some new togs, Curt. How do you
like this?”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of buying any new clothes,”
said Kendall. But the idea, once presented, had
attractions. He looked at the neat gray suit Ned
was displaying and thought that he would like
to see himself in it. Besides, he had never before
really shopped for himself and the sudden realization
of his independence was oddly exhilarating.
He looked longingly at the clothes. Then he
tentatively held a coat up to the light, Ned observing
him out of the corners of his shrewd
eyes.</p>

<p>“That one you’ve got there would look fine on
you, Curt,” he said. “Why don’t you just slip
it on?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” exclaimed Kendall.</p>

<p>“Go ahead! There’s a room right back of you.
Where are the trousers?”</p>

<p>“Those would be a little large for the gentleman,”
said the clerk. “Just a moment, please.”
In a jiffy he was back again and Kendall, almost
before he realized it, was behind a curtain in a
little closet-like apartment with the gray suit on
his arm. When he emerged Ned exhibited the
utmost enthusiasm:</p>

<p>“My word, Curt, but that suit was made for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
you! And fit! Why, it couldn’t be better, could
it?” He appealed to the salesman.</p>

<p>“It would require almost no alteration,” replied
the latter. “Perhaps the least bit off the
sleeves. And the buttons might be set over a
trifle.”</p>

<p>“It—it doesn’t look badly, does it?” murmured
Kendall, turning and twisting in front of a long
mirror.</p>

<p>“Bad! My dear misguided youth, it becomes
you horribly! Don’t hesitate a minute; take it
along!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but—but—I hadn’t thought of buying!”
explained Kendall.</p>

<p>“Think now, then. You don’t want to lose that
suit, Curt. If you put off getting it someone will
take it.”</p>

<p>“There are probably more of them,” answered
Kendall, torn between his desire for the suit and
the promptings of economy.</p>

<p>“That’s the only one of your size, sir,” said
the clerk. “If you really think of getting it, sir,
I’d advise you to do it to-day.”</p>

<p>“We-ell—” began Kendall.</p>

<p>“You can make the alterations and deliver it
to-morrow, can’t you?” Ned asked. The clerk
agreed that he could.</p>

<p>Then a man whom the clerk referred to as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
bushelman appeared with a tape measure and a
square of chalk and the die was cast.</p>

<p>“But I haven’t enough money with me,” whispered
Kendall to Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s all right. They’ll charge it to you if
you like, or you can pay them when they deliver
it.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather do that,” said Kendall. “It’s
twelve dollars, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Twelve-fifty. Want anything else to-day?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!”</p>

<p>“Then we’d better be hitting the trail. We’ve
only got twenty minutes to get back in.”</p>

<p>“It’s funny about that suit,” mused Kendall
after they were across the bridge. “I hadn’t any
sort of idea of buying anything when I went in
with you. You were the one who was looking for
clothes, Ned, and you didn’t buy a thing!”</p>

<p>“I was just looking. You certainly surprised
me, Curt. I hadn’t any idea you’d be such a
sport. It’s funny how things happen like that.
Sometimes a fellow hasn’t any idea of doing a
thing, and then, first thing he knows, he’s gone
and done it! Queer, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” murmured Kendall. “But—it’s a
mighty good-looking suit of clothes, isn’t it?”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>GOLF WITH BROADWOOD</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">All that week Kendall had wished that there
were two of him that he might both follow
football practice and pursue the tantalizing
intricacies of golf and the friendship of Ned
Tooker. He had attended football practice only
twice, on Tuesday and Thursday, and practice
was getting very interesting and exciting now, for
there was a scrimmage every afternoon between
the first and second teams, and, since it was now
the height of the season, those scrimmages were
no love-feast. Every player was animated either
by the stern determination to hold his place at
all costs—if he was a first-string man—or to wrest
someone else’s place from him—if he was a substitute.
And so it was nip and tuck between many
good friends. There was an exciting contest on
between Norton, the regular right end, and Sayer,
a younger fellow who was the first choice substitute.
And Arthur Thompson had created a mild
sensation by beating out both Green and Fayette
and standing an excellent show of playing for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
time at least in the remaining games as a substitute
to Stearns. The rivalry for the position of
quarter-back was less intense just for the reason
that it was Payson’s policy to use both Simms and
Holmes to about the same extent. Hammel,
Simms, Ridge and Norton had been receiving special
instruction in punting and drop-kicking every
day for a week past, but Simms and Norton were
the only ones who it seemed had profited much.
Simms was getting off better punts and Norton
was gradually developing into a fair drop-kicker.
It was this dawning ability that might insure him
his position and defeat Sayer’s ambition.</p>

<p>On Saturday the team left early in the forenoon
for East Point to play Carrel’s School, and with
the team went fully half the student body, almost
all, in fact, who could obtain permission and
enough money to meet the expenses of the trip.
Kendall, of course, was barred from going by his
probation. And he gathered comfort from the
thought that even if he had not been on probation
he still would have been forced to remain at home,
since in purchasing that suit of clothes he had
virtually bankrupted himself. However, Fate
provided him with a fairly satisfactory substitute
for the football game in the golf match that afternoon
between Yardley and Broadwood. The
Broadwood representatives were on hand early;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
seven of them in all. They were a nice-looking lot
of boys; Kendall mentally called them “swells,”
but in no derogatory sense, since, now that he was
the possessor of a new suit of clothes and had
discovered a blue necktie among his belongings,
he secretly considered entering that class himself!</p>

<p>When Kendall reached the course, the drawings
had been made and the first two competitors, Kirk
of Yardley and Osgood of Broadwood, were just
starting off. Ned was busily talking with a group
of boys and so Kendall joined the small gallery
of stay-at-homes. Kirk had the best of the first
drive and the two boys strode off. Presently
Wainwright and a tall youth named Linton drove,
and they too took their departure. A third couple
followed them, Morgan of Yardley and Carter of
Broadwood. Kendall let them go, although a few
of the onlookers had dribbled away at the heels
of the various pairs. Kendall meant to go around
with Ned. The latter had loaned him a book of
rules and a book of instruction—very interesting,
the latter, with many pictures and much puzzling
advice—and Kendall had been absorbing them
both in his leisure moments. At least, he had
managed to obtain a fair idea of the general principles
of the game, although a great deal of it
was still Greek to him.</p>

<p>Ned and his rival, who turned out to be Frost,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Broadwood’s best player, started next, leaving
Simpson, Yardley, and Sawyer, Broadwood, to
follow. Kendall remembered that Ned had termed
Frost Broadwood’s crack exponent of the game
and wondered whether Ned had met his match.
Most of the onlookers, like Kendall, had been waiting
for this contest and now gathered around the
tee. Ned caught sight of Kendall while Frost,
whose honor it was, was fixing his tee.</p>

<p>“Hello, Curt!” he said, “how are you to-day?
And where are those new clothes we got yesterday?
Didn’t they send them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, but I thought I wouldn’t wear them
to-day. They’re—they’re sort of best, don’t you
see.”</p>

<p>Ned stared for a moment and then a grin
spread over his face and he began to chuckle.
Kendall viewed him with surprise.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing, nothing at all,” laughed Ned. “Just
a joke I happened to think of, a joke on yours
truly. I’m glad I did think of it, too, for I just
needed a good laugh to start this match on.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to beat him?” asked Kendall,
lowering his voice. Ned, watching Frost prepare
to drive, shook his head:</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Curt. I think so, but we’ll sait
and wee. If I have luck and do beat him we’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
probably win the match. Wasn’t it luck that I
drew Frost? Kirk ought to win his game from
Osgood without much trouble and Jim Morgan’s
sure to beat his man. That would give us our
three out of five. Well, coming around? Good!
See you later.” Ned walked toward the tee.
“That was a peach, Frost,” he said, as his opponent’s
ball went arching away across the
bunker.</p>

<p>Ned’s own drive was a few yards shorter but
left him on the right side of the hazard, and players
and gallery started off. Kendall knew one
or two of the fellows to speak to, notably Teller
Sanford who had come out to watch his roommate
play. Sanford ran across Kendall presently
and seemed quite cordial in his rather stiff way.
They kept together more or less during the match
and, since neither of them knew much golf, asked
each other many questions and gave what answers
they could. They both were anxious that Ned
should win, however, and that was a bond between
them. The first hole, 230 yards, was reached in
4 by both players. Four, Teller explained, was
bogey. Ned looked wise and nodded, secretly determining
to find out what “bogey” might mean.</p>

<p>The course at Yardley is fairly level, and, save
for the seventh, none of the holes are very difficult.
The distance for the nine holes is 2170 yards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and the bogey is 35 strokes. (Ned had once done
it in 38, equaling the school record.) It was stroke
competition to-day and the match was to go to the
side winning three out of five games of eighteen
holes. The second was reached by both Ned and
Frost in 4, one over bogey. So far their cards
were even at 8 strokes. But on the next hole Ned
had a piece of bad luck, slicing his drive so that
it took him an extra stroke to cross the bunker
and Frost took the hole in 5 to Ned’s 6. By that
time it was apparent even to Kendall that the
Broadwood player was superior to Ned with his
driver. Frost’s drives were quite remarkable.
They had both length and direction. Ned drove
a slightly shorter ball and was more uncertain
as to direction. (Kendall overheard one knowing
spectator observe that “Tooker tees too high;
that’s the trouble with him.”) But with the iron
Ned was better than his opponent. He seemed
able to place his ball just where he wanted it on
approach shots and more than once so far he had
gained the hole with only one putt. When it came
to the use of the putter there appeared little choice
between the two boys. Each seemed possessed of
a deadly certainty with that implement in hand.
The fourth hole was halved and at the fifth Ned
had evened the score. Each made the sixth in
5 and the seventh in 6. That was the one difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
hole of the course. It was 375 yards long and
combined a “bowl” and a bunker in such a way
that a perfect approach to the green was an impossibility.
The bogey was 5, and in doing it in
6 each of the players won applause. Ned took
the lead at the next hole by an eight-foot putt
that was a marvel of precision and finished the
first round by another 3 to his opponent’s 4, leaving
him two strokes to the good. Ned came over
to where Kendall and Teller Sanford were standing
and talked a minute before the next round
began.</p>

<p>“What do you think of Kirk?” he asked in disgust.
“He’s four under Osgood at the ninth!
I thought that for once he meant to win his
match.”</p>

<p>“How are you feeling?” asked Kendall
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Dine and fandy,” replied Ned flippantly.
“Say, can’t that fellow drive, though? He’s a lot
better than he was in the spring. Has anybody
heard how Jack Simpson is getting on?”</p>

<p>Kendall and Teller shook their heads.</p>

<p>“Morgan was four to the good at the ninth, I
heard. I guess he’s safe. Well, here goes.”</p>

<p>The first hole was halved again, as in the first
round, at four each. At the second Frost made
a remarkable drive that left him well up. An iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
shot laid the ball within four feet of the hole and
he went out in 3, which was bogey. Ned’s drive
was twenty yards shorter than his adversary’s
and his iron shot left him on the edge of the green.
He holed out in 4. The third and fourth holes
were taken by each in 5 and 6 respectively. At the
fifth Ned again got the worst of it, overrunning
a short putt, and on the sixth foozled a short approach
shot. The score then for the round was,
Ned 29, Frost 26; for the two rounds, Ned 68,
Frost 67. Broadwood was one stroke ahead and
there were three holes to play.</p>

<p>On the way to the seventh tee Ned sought Kendall
and drew him to one side. “I’m one stroke
behind, Curt,” he said, “but <a href="#i_fp166">I think I can win the
match if you make it worth my while</a>.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 381px;">
<a id="i_fp166">
  <img src="images/i_fp166.jpg" width="381" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_167">“‘I think I can win the match if you make it worth my while.’”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Me!” exclaimed Kendall. “Why, what can I
do?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you. I’ll make a bargain with you.
If you’ll promise to wear your new suit every
day I’ll win the game. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t see—”</p>

<p>“Oh, just a fancy of mine, Curt. I’m such a
whimsical cut-up! What do you say?”</p>

<p>“Wear my new suit every day?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll let you off sometimes. Let me see;
I have it; you may wear your old clothes on the
thirty-first of the month.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Kendall smiled. “I suppose it’s some sort of
a joke,” he said, “but I don’t see it.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. It’s a go, eh?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I’ll wear my new clothes if you
like, only I don’t see—”</p>

<p>“I know you don’t. It’s a mystery. All right,
then. Here’s where I win the game. Wish me
luck, Curt.”</p>

<p>“Of course. And, Ned, I heard a fellow say a
while ago that he thought you teed too high. I
don’t know just what he meant, but—”</p>

<p>“He was right. I’ve always known it, though.
It’s a fault I can’t correct, Curt. I hate to be
stingy with the sand. So long!”</p>

<p>Bogey for the seventh hole was 5, but no one
in the history of the links had ever done it in
that. The tee was on the edge of the hill in a
space cleared of trees and the hole was 375 yards
away in a line with the boathouse. From the tee
the ground sloped abruptly to a hollow called The
Bowl. Then came a rise to a bunker, a further
rise beyond that to the summit of the knoll and
then, out of sight from the approach, lay the
green. An average drive laid the ball on the side
of the hill, just short of The Bowl. A long drive
took you into the hollow. In either case it meant
two strokes with lofter or mashie to get over the
bunker. From there to the hole had always been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
a matter of two at the least. There was a “longer
way round,” however, generally affected by the
poorer players. By this route The Bowl was entirely
avoided, the player driving along the edge
of the slope and crossing to the hole past the end
of the bunker. This, however, usually meant an
8 for the hole; possibly a 9.</p>

<p>It was Frost’s honor and he teed his ball very
carefully, using the merest pinch of sand. Conversation
had dwindled away of late. Much
depended on these last three holes and both contestants
were saving their breath and thinking instead
of talking. The gallery whispered amongst
themselves, but very generally respected the players’
desire for silence. Frost took his stance,
weighed his driver, looked at the slope beyond
the bowl a moment and swung. Back came the
club until it hung for an instant behind his left
hip. Then up it went, slowly at first, then faster,
the head traveling a wide arc ere it swooped down
upon the ball. There was a hard, crisp <em>click</em> and
away sped the guttie, a white speck in the sunlight,
straight in line with the distant hole and
at just the right height. There was a little spurt
of gravel on the slope beyond the hollow where
the grass was thin, the ball leaped into the air,
came down again several yards beyond and then
nestled to earth. It was the longest drive Frost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
had made that day, and probably the longest ever
made from the seventh tee, and a murmur of applause
came from the gallery. Frost stepped
aside, an expression of pleasure showing in spite
of his efforts.</p>

<p>Ned smiled. “Some drive, that, Frost,” he said
as he dipped his hand in the sand box. “As pretty
as I ever saw.”</p>

<p>“Not so bad,” replied Frost modestly.</p>

<p>“I should say not!” Ned walked to the far
corner of the tee and placed his little pinch of
sand on the ground, carefully shaping it between
his fingers. Then he put his ball on it. But he
took it up the next moment and flicked away a
half inch from the top of the little cone. When
he faced the ball the gallery saw with surprise
that he was going to play the “longest way
round.” The surprise became audible and some
of the older boys frowned their neighbors into
silence. Ned lost no time in preliminaries. Back
came his club and then up in a wide sweep and
down again. Off went the ball, low and hard. A
dead leaf fluttered down from a branch, showing
where the guttie had just escaped coming to grief
against an out-reaching limb. Straight along the
edge of the hill it sped, ten feet or so above the
ground at the top of its arc, and struck, bounded
and rolled. It was a good drive, a remarkably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
good one for Ned, and the gallery’s approval was
loud and continued, even while they failed to see
Ned’s reason for driving in that direction. He
had put his ball almost as far from the tee as
Frost’s, but it lay much farther from the hole.
The players parted company and the gallery split
up into two groups, more than half of them choosing
to follow Ned’s fortunes.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem to me,” ventured Kendall,
“that he gained anything by putting his ball up
there.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look so,” replied Teller, “but it’s
all right. Ned will win now. He’s laughing. He
always laughs when he’s at his best. I’ve seen
it lots of times.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” murmured Kendall as he followed
the others along the edge of the woods. When
Ned reached his ball he looked at it for several
moments. Then he studied the course ahead. Below
him at the right lay The Bowl. Between him
and the little red flag at the hole lay a hollow,
with a corner of the bunker elbowing into line.
One advantage was with him. He was now only
a scant yard or two below the level of the bunker,
whereas Frost must work uphill all the way to
the green. Ned’s ball lay on a slight slope, so
that he had to stand several inches above it. But
it was not cupped. It lay nestled in a little tuft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of dry grass, with a tiny twig holding it from
rolling further down the slope. Ned thoughtfully
picked out his lofter. Then he as thoughtfully
slipped it back into the bag and drew forth a
brassie. Several of the knowing ones shook their
heads. It seemed a bad lie for a brassie shot, they
thought. But Ned faced the hole, swung the club
and had luck with him. The ball struck the opposite
hillside, bounded high in the air and fell dead
only four yards from the bunker! A yell of
astonishment and delight went up from the
watchers.</p>

<p>“What did I tell you?” demanded Teller with
a pleased smile on his face.</p>

<p>“But—but he oughtn’t to have used that brass
club, then,” objected Kendall. “The book says
so!”</p>

<p>“I guess the book was wrong.” Teller nodded
at the distant ball. “There’s the answer to
that.”</p>

<p>Below them Frost was making his second
stroke. Up the hill went the ball, landed, jumped
a foot or two into the air, came down and trickled
back a yard before it found lodgment.</p>

<p>“He will be lucky if he gets over from there in
one,” Kendall heard one of the gallery remark.
“He’s thirty yards from the bunker and way below
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>But he did get over, making a very pretty shot
with a niblick and just grazing the top of the
bunker. Ned went over neatly and the ball
bounded out of sight toward the green. Frost’s
fourth stroke took him well onto the green, but
at the left of the hole. It was apparent that Ned,
playing 4, could at least tie the hole in 6. But
when his ball was found it lay only twenty yards
or so from the hole and visions of a bogey score
floated before the eyes of the excited audience.
Smilingly and, as it looked, almost carelessly, Ned
took his mashie, cast one short glance at the flag
and hit the ball. Up and away it went in a short
arching flight.</p>

<p>“Too hard,” someone groaned behind Kendall.
But Kendall, his heart in his mouth, saw the ball
drop, make one feeble effort to bound, and then
lie dead within a yard of the flag!</p>

<p>Something that was like a hushed cheer went
up from the gallery which had now reunited and
had drawn aside at the edge of the green. Ned
slipped his mashie back into his bag with a fine
unconcern and took out his putter. Frost at the
side of the green was looking rather serious as
he bent over his ball. His fifth stroke left him
within a scant two feet of the hole. The audience
literally held their breath as Ned brushed
aside an invisible obstacle in his path to the goal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
measured the distance and direction with his eye
and swung his putter back gently. <em>Tap!</em> Forward
rolled the ball, straight for the hole, but oh,
so slowly! Three inches away from the edge it
seemed about to stop, but it changed its mind and
trickled on—on—and then, pop, it was out of
sight!</p>

<p>A breath of relief went up from the watchers,
but it was not until Frost had holed out that the
applause came. Then a dozen fellows pressed
around Ned to slap him on the back and shake his
hand. “Five, Tooker! That bogey! It’s never
been done before! Oh, you Ned Tooker!” Frost
shook hands with him, too, hiding his discomfiture
as best he could. As they took up the journey
to the eighth tee the score for the two rounds
stood at 73 each, and the match depended on the
next two holes.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>DAN IS OUT OF SORTS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The eighth hole is a short one, 150 yards, and
the bogey is 3. A long drive, a short approach
and you’re on the green. The hole
has been done in 3 a good many times, and to-day
both Ned and his adversary equaled bogey. At
the ninth tee the excitement amongst the audience
had grown intense. The ninth was five yards
shorter than the last hole and was an easy one.
There was a bunker near enough the tee to punish
a weak drive, but after that it was fair sailing.
Ned made a hard, straight drive that was a fraction
too high. Had there been even a mild breeze
he would have suffered in direction. Frost’s ball
went lower, skimming above the bunker with only
a half-dozen feet to spare, and doing a remarkable
amount of rolling after it had struck the smooth
turf. It was a fine long shot and bettered Ned’s
by fifteen yards. The gallery unanimously agreed
as they took up their way across the links and
skirted the bunker that the match depended now
on the next strokes. Frost had the advantage in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
distance, but it was felt that Ned was quite capable
of overcoming that handicap, since on midiron
plays he had shown himself superior to Frost
all the afternoon.</p>

<p>Ned was away and played first, using his
mashie. The ball went away high and the gallery
watched its arch with breathless interest. It
struck on the green, about two yards out of line
with the flag, and apparently quite near the hole.
One of the players who had finished his game and,
with the others, was standing near the home green,
waved his hand and cut a caper. Frost selected
a midiron for his approach. For the first time
that day he seemed nervous, and was an unusually
long time in making his shot. It had good
direction, struck well this side of the green and
rolled smoothly on until it lay within four yards
of the hole. The gallery hurried to the green,
the two players following more leisurely. Ned’s
lie was almost but not quite as good as Frost’s,
being just over four paces distant from the hole,
while Frost’s was just under. Kirk stepped forward
and lifted the flag from the hole, treading
across the short turf as though presiding at a
funeral. The gallery ranged itself around the
green, determined not to miss a thrill.</p>

<p>Ned looked critically along the line to the hole,
swung his putter once or twice from the wrists and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
addressed his ball. Had a grasshopper sneezed at
that moment every member of the gallery would
have jumped a foot! Ned swung his club back
gently, brought it smoothly forward, there was
a little tap and the ball ran swiftly toward the
hole. Ned had put too much force into the stroke,
for the ball reached the edge of the cup, leaped
across and trickled on for a yard! A murmur
of dismay went up. Kendall’s heart sank. Frost
gripped his putter, brushed aside a tiny pebble,
settled himself and tapped his ball very gently.
His direction was good, but, having determined
not to fall into Ned’s error, he erred on the other
side and the ball traveled a scant two yards. A
sigh of relief arose about Kendall; he caught a
boy grinning at him and grinned back; Teller Sanford’s
black eyes were gleaming with excitement.
There was only a tied match to hope for now,
but that was better than the defeat that would
have come had Frost holed out in his first try.
But even a yard is a long way sometimes when
much depends on the result, and there was a good
deal of suspense while Ned measured the distance
and swung his putter. But this time the ball
behaved itself and dropped into the hole with a
comforting thud. A sigh of relief went up from
all around. Then every eye fixed itself on the
Broadwood player. Two yards was not a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
putt for Frost, but there was always the chance
that he wouldn’t make it, and as he sped the little
ball forward more than one onlooker gripped
his hands. It began to slow down soon after it
left the club; a foot from the hole it was barely
rolling; at the very brink of the hole it paused,
seemed to look into the abyss before it, shudder
and stop. For an instant no one moved or
breathed. It seemed that the ball would drop over
the edge at any instant. But it didn’t. Frost,
watching it, shrugged his shoulders and walked toward
it.</p>

<p>“Oh, call it in!” cried Ned, and jumped in the
hope of jarring the ground sufficiently to set the
ball in motion. But the thing was obdurate. It
never stirred. Frost tapped it with his putter
and it rolled out of sight. Then he turned to Ned
with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>“You win, Tooker,” he said, with a smile. He
was a little bit pale. Ned shook hands, but—</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” he said. “I’m not going to take
the game on a fluke like that. We’ll call it a
draw, Frost, and play another nine.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” replied Frost. “It was a fair win.”</p>

<p>He reached down and rescued his ball from the
hole. Then he walked very deliberately to the
edge of the green, dropped the ball on the turf,
swung his putter and sent the offending guttie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
flying into the river. Then he came back, a smile
on his face.</p>

<p>“I feel better,” he said to Ned, with a laugh.
“Well, we had a close game of it, Tooker, and
you deserved to win. Wonder how the other
games came out.”</p>

<p>“It’s two to two,” said Linton. “The match
depends on those chaps.” He nodded across to
where Simpson and Sawyer were preparing to
drive off from the ninth tee.</p>

<p>“Who won?” asked Ned of Kirk.</p>

<p>“I lost,” answered Kirk unhappily. “It was
86 to 90. I’m awfully sorry, Ned.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter. How did the others come
out?”</p>

<p>“Pete lost to Linton and Jim Morgan beat Carter.
What was your score, Ned?”</p>

<p>“I was 79 and Frost 80. Anyone heard how
Simpson is getting on?”</p>

<p>“He was four to the bad at the end of the first
round,” replied Kirk. “I guess he’s out of it.”</p>

<p>And he was. Sawyer, of Broadwood, finished
triumphantly with a lead of 6 strokes under Jack
Simpson and Broadwood had won the match, three
games out of five.</p>

<p>“Well, we will have to try you again in the
spring,” said Ned to Frost.</p>

<p>“We’ll be glad to,” the other answered. “And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
I hope you and I, Tooker, can get together again.
You’re the best I ever ran up against, but I’m
not convinced I can’t beat you.”</p>

<p>“I daresay you will the next time,” laughed
Ned. “Good-by. We’ve had a dandy time.”</p>

<p>Ned, Kendall and Teller Sanford walked back
together, Ned a little disappointed.</p>

<p>“I don’t care if we did get beaten,” said Kendall,
“as long as you won your game, Ned.”</p>

<p>“I do,” Ned replied. “I thought sure we’d get
a fall out of them this time. Hang ’em, we’ve
never managed to win since I’ve been here! But
you wait until next spring! Gee, but I’m tired!
I’m going to have a hot and cold shower, fellows.
I’ll see you later.”</p>

<p>The Football Team came back to school in time
for a late supper, wearied and happy. Carrel’s
School had been vanquished to the tune of 22 to 3,
and it seemed that at last Yardley had found her
pace. Carrel’s three points had been made by a
field goal in the first three minutes of play. After
that the home team had never had a chance and
Yardley had scored a touchdown in each period
and had kicked two goals out of four, Hammel
succeeding once out of three tries and Dan Vinton
securing the other. Only one incident had marred
the game. Arthur Thompson, playing right half
in the third period, had sprained his knee and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
would be out of the game for the rest of the
season.</p>

<p>The school in general was too happy over the
size of the score to pay much attention to this misfortune
at first. But by the next day it was realized
that the team had sustained a serious loss
in Thompson. He had proved himself head and
shoulders above any of the other half-back substitutes,
and it was scarcely to be supposed that both
Roeder and Stearns would be so fortunate as to
play through the rest of the season uninterruptedly.
Now, in case either was forced to retire, his
duties would fall to Green or Fayette, neither of
whom could be called a first-class back.</p>

<p>Gerald hurried over to Arthur’s room in Whitson
as soon as he heard the bad news and found
a very despondent-looking invalid. Arthur had
had his supper in bed, and the doctor had just
gone, after wrapping the injured knee in yards of
gauze.</p>

<p>“How’s this for luck?” asked Arthur miserably.
“I can stand not playing football any more
this fall, but what about pole-vaulting? I’ll make
a fine Track Team captain if I have to hobble
around with a cane!”</p>

<p>“It isn’t as bad as that, is it?” asked Gerald
anxiously. “What did the doctor say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he didn’t say much of anything. Said it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
would be all right in a week or two, but that I’d
have to be careful of it for a month or so after
I got out. I asked him if it would interfere with
pole work and he just hemmed and hawed and
looked wise in that silly way doctors have. I’d
like to kick him!”</p>

<p>“Why, of course it will be all right by spring,
Arthur,” Gerald said with conviction. “Look at
the people who sprain their ankles and wrists and—and
things every day!”</p>

<p>“Well, why didn’t he say so, then?” asked
Arthur crossly. “Besides, pole-vaulting puts a
lot of work on a fellow’s knees, and if mine is
stiff and creaky I won’t be able to do ten-feet-six!”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure you will! Buck up, Arthur. Tell me
about the game.”</p>

<p>“The game? Oh, it was all right, I guess. Tom
was a wonder to-day; went through ’em as though
they were paper. And Hammel was a dandy, too,
even if he did miss two goals.”</p>

<p>“How did Dan play?”</p>

<p>“Rotten, if you want the unvarnished truth,
Gerald. I don’t know what’s the matter with Dan.
I suppose, though, it’s just being captain that’s
queering his game. He dropped two passes to-day
and was as slow as molasses down the field.
I guess Dan’s gone fine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Gerald nodded. “I thought he seemed to have
the dumps this evening,” he murmured thoughtfully.
“Do you know, Arthur, I’m a bit worried
about Dan.” Arthur looked a question and Gerald
continued: “He isn’t the same chap he was
last year. He’s cross about half the time, and
nervous as a—a—”</p>

<p>“As a hen. Hens are awfully nervous,
Gerald.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is. He worries all the time because
he’s afraid Broadwood may lick us, and every
time a player stubs his toe or skins his knuckles
Dan has a fit.”</p>

<p>“I know.” Arthur nodded. “What he needs
is the rest cure. He ought to take my place for
a week.”</p>

<p>“I wish he could,” said Gerald.</p>

<p>“So do I!”</p>

<p>“He said he was coming over here later to see
how you were.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll have to be smiling and happy or he
will jump into the river, I suppose,” Arthur
growled. “Oh, hang the luck, anyway!”</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry,” said Gerald sympathetically.
“If you want anything while you’re laid
up, or if there’s anything I can do—”</p>

<p>“Thanks. There isn’t, though. Hello! Come
in!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Dan who had knocked and who, at
Arthur’s invitation, entered. At his heels came
Tom Roeder. Dan had a frown on his forehead
and looked tired and worried.</p>

<p>“Hello!” greeted Arthur cheerfully. “Hello,
Tom! What price me?”</p>

<p>“It’s a shame, Arthur,” said Dan. “I don’t
know what the team is going to do without you,
either.”</p>

<p>“Going to win,” laughed Arthur. “Don’t let
that bother you.”</p>

<p>“How are you feeling?” asked Dan anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, fine! I could get up and walk around,
only that brute of a doctor won’t let me.”</p>

<p>“You’d better not try it,” said Tom sternly.
“What does he say about the knee?”</p>

<p>“All right in a week or so.”</p>

<p>“It’s my fault for insisting on your coming out
for the team,” Dan grieved.</p>

<p>“Your fault! Poppycock! That’s nonsense to
talk like that,” responded Arthur. “Besides,
there’s no harm done. My old knee will be as fit
as a fiddle in a few days.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to miss you on the team, though,”
said Dan mournfully.</p>

<p>Arthur laughed. “You’ll never know I’ve
gone,” he said. “Now, for the love of mud, Dan,
stop looking like a bereaved cow. Cheer up!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve been trying to get him to cheer up all
the evening,” said Tom, “and he hasn’t smiled a
single smile yet. Honest, Dan, things aren’t half
as bad as you look!”</p>

<p>Dan did smile then rather wanly. “I’m tired,”
he said. “That’s all that’s the matter with me.
Payson says I’ve got to lay off for a day or two,
though. I guess I’d better, after the exhibition
I put up to-day. Pretty poor, wasn’t it, Tom?”</p>

<p>“So-so,” replied Tom untroubledly. “Don’t
let it bother you. We all go to pieces now and
then. Payson’s right, though, old man, and you
do need a bit of a rest. Next Saturday you’ll feel
like a fighting cock and play like a house afire!”</p>

<p>“Hope so. Well, I told Payson I’d go down
and see him for a minute. I’m awfully sorry
about this, Arthur. If there’s any sort of thing
I can do, let me know, won’t you? Good night.
Good night, fellows.”</p>

<p>Dan departed. For a moment no one said anything.
Arthur, however, raised his brows, and
Tom shook his head as much as to say, “Don’t
ask me!”</p>

<p>“He’s got it bad,” remarked Arthur finally.
“Well, I daresay it’s not much fun being football
captain at a school where nearly three hundred
fellows are watching you all the time and
expecting you to turn out a winning team no matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
what the conditions may be. I guess it’s
natural enough to get nervous now and then.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” Tom agreed. “I’ll bet I’d be
batty in no time if I was cap. I hope Dan gets
over it before next Saturday, though.”</p>

<p>“He will. Payson will steady him down all
right.”</p>

<p>“I daresay. Poor old Dan sure did play a punk
game to-day.”</p>

<p>“He kicked that goal in good shape, though,”
said Gerald.</p>

<p>“You’re right,” Tom agreed. “It was a dandy.
Almost as good as that friend of yours could have
done, Arthur.”</p>

<p>“What friend of mine?”</p>

<p>Tom winked at Gerald. “Why, that chap you
saw kicking goals in your sleep that day.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t asleep,” answered Arthur with a
frown. “I don’t care if he couldn’t be found;
I saw him all right.”</p>

<p>“Well, if there is such a chap,” said Tom, “why
doesn’t he show up? Payson has hunted the
whole school through.”</p>

<p>“I have an idea,” said Gerald, “that he wasn’t
one of our fellows at all, that he was some village
chap who came up and used the field knowing
there wouldn’t be anyone there in the morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of that,” Arthur replied.
“I’ll just bet that was it!”</p>

<p>“The explanation,” agreed Tom gravely, “is
plausible. I am glad to hear it, Arthur. It restores
my faith in your veracity.”</p>

<p>Dan did no work on Monday, Tuesday nor
Wednesday. The coach even refused to allow him
to visit the field the first two days. By Thursday,
Dan’s attack of nerves had apparently departed.
There was an extra hard practice that afternoon
in preparation for the game with Porter Institute.
Porter was known to have what Tom called
“a corking lot of huskies,” and was expected to
give a good deal of trouble. And so it turned
out.</p>

<p>Saturday was a miserable day. It had started
to rain Friday evening and had kept it up all
night. At eleven the sun shone for a few moments
and it was hoped that the afternoon would be fair.
But by dinner time the rain was coming down
again “fently but girmly,” to use Ned Tooker’s
phrase, and so it continued all during the game,
clearing finally when the Porter team was rolling
stationward with Yardley’s scalps hanging from
their belts. For Yardley met her first defeat that
day.</p>

<p>Porter Institute had a fine team; there was no
gainsaying that; but it must be also acknowledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
that Yardley did not play up to form. A fumble
by the Porter full-back a few minutes after the
game started gave the home team its one lone
score. Dan picked up the ball and, with Mitchell
assisting for a time, sprinted down the field for
seventy yards and a touchdown. Hammel missed
the goal with great ease.</p>

<p>After that Yardley was on the defensive for the
rest of the first two periods and managed to hold
Porter from scoring, although the Blue’s goal was
twice threatened. Porter, however, came back
strong after the rest and hammered out a touchdown
in the third period and kicked a goal. Yardley
brought everything to bear that she knew after
that and succeeded in reaching Porter’s twenty-six
yards. From there, had she possessed a drop-kicker
of fair ability, she might have made a field-goal.
But Dan and Simms consulted and decided
that they had better not risk it, although Norton
had been showing fair work in practice. Instead,
they went at Porter’s line again and after two
downs, which netted them a scant four yards, tried
a forward pass that went to a Porter back and lost
them the ball. That was Yardley’s only chance to
score. In the last period Porter found her adversary’s
line less easy and tried end runs and forward
passes and on-side kicks. When the game
was almost over Porter had the ball on Yardley’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
thirty-three yards, made two on a wide run around
Norton, and worked the ball back into the center
of the gridiron by a whirlwind shift followed by
an attack at the guard-tackle hole. With two
yards to go the Porter right half stepped back
and put the pigskin straight over the bar by a
drop-kick, adding another three points to her six.
That was the last scoring, and the final account
stood 9 to 5.</p>

<p>Dan redeemed himself that day, playing his position
brilliantly. The principal fault with the
team as a whole was slowness and lack of aggressiveness.
The center of the line was especially
lacking in the latter. Some two hundred rain-coated
youths splashed up the hill after the final
whistle had sounded looking rather glum. There
were many criticisms. Most of the fellows held
that Dan had erred in not trying a goal from the
field in the third period. Others pointed out that
even had Yardley kicked that goal she would still
have been beaten by a point, and maintained that
Dan had done the proper thing in trying for a
touchdown, which, had it been secured, would have
given the contest to the home team. But by the
time supper was over the critical attitude passed.
After all, Porter Institute was only Porter Institute,
and no one really cared very much about her.
It was bad to be beaten, but the defeat might act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
as a tonic and nerve the home team to a grand
and impressive victory over Broadwood. And the
defeat of Broadwood was the chief aim and consideration.</p>

<p>But Dan was once more in the depths. He had
hoped for a clean slate that fall and now here was
a beating to be chalked up against him. Payson
shrugged his shoulders and smiled, but Dan took
the defeat very tragically and refused to be comforted.</p>

<p>“There’s something wrong with our fellows,”
he declared in Payson’s room in the village that
evening. “They don’t <em>play</em>! They don’t seem to
have any <em>punch</em>! They—”</p>

<p>“The team’s all right,” interrupted Payson
quietly. “They aren’t playing the best they know
how, Vinton, but they will two weeks from to-day;
and that’s what we want, isn’t it? We don’t want
a team that reaches high water mark a fortnight
before our big game, you know. They’re coming
all right. This week we’ll hammer some speed
into them and give them the new signals. We
won’t have to fuss with more than six new plays,
and that’s fortunate. If the fellows come on
slowly, as they’ve been coming and as they ought
to come, we can work them hard right up to the
Broadwood game and not be afraid of having them
go fine. And that’s what I’m hoping for, Vinton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
We haven’t had what I call a simon-pure
slump all season, and I don’t want one now. Porter
had a well-developed team, my boy, a team at
least a week ahead of us. And they outplayed us.
If we had won from them to-day our fellows would
have gone into a slump next week as sure as fate.
Don’t ask me why, because I can’t tell you; but
I know I’m right. It’s a matter of psychology, I
fancy. I’ve seen it too often. No, we’re doing
well enough. There’s no need to worry. So don’t
do it. The first thing you know you’ll be all
worked up and no use to the team just when you’re
wanted the most. Get out of doors to-morrow,
Vinton, and take a long walk. Take someone with
you who will talk of something besides football.
Forget football for a day, will you? Just try,
eh?”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Dan with a smile. “I suppose
I am getting sort of cranky. But you don’t
happen to know where I’m likely to find a fellow
at this time of year who won’t talk football, do
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can find one,” laughed Payson.
“Take a fellow who has some other interest. You
football chaps are likely to think that everyone is
just as interested in the game as you are. Did
you know that the Yardley Golf Team had a
match with Broadwood last Saturday?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” replied Dan uninterestedly. “Who
won?”</p>

<p>“Broadwood, I believe. I just mention it to
show that while you and most of the school were
‘footballing’ there were a few chaps who were absorbed
in something entirely different. By the
way, do you know Tooker, the golf captain?”</p>

<p>“Yes, fairly well.”</p>

<p>“All right. There’s your man. Get him to walk
with you. Start out after church and take a good
long tramp. Go over to Lloyd and have your
dinner there. It’s six miles or so over there and
there’s a very good little hotel. After dinner sit
around and come back in time for supper. I wish
you’d do that, Vinton. Will you?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, if you really want me to,” said
Dan doubtfully. “But I don’t see much use in
it. And I don’t believe Ned Tooker will care to
go.”</p>

<p>“Well, ask him. If he won’t, find someone else.
But don’t take any of the team along. Get away
from football for one day. You’ll be surprised
to find how it will tone you up. By the way, how’s
your appetite?”</p>

<p>Dan made a face. Payson nodded:</p>

<p>“I thought so. Well, I’ll wager you anything
you like that if you’ll do what I say to-morrow
you’ll eat enough dinner for a dozen men. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
you needn’t stick to training diet, either. Eat
whatever they give you, and lots of it.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you take your own medicine?”
asked Dan. “Can’t you go along with me?”</p>

<p>“I could, but you’d be dragging in football
every minute. And,” laughed the coach, “if you
didn’t I should! No, you do it the way I said.
Tooker’s a good chap; he will make you laugh,
and that’s what you need.”</p>

<p>After Dan had taken his departure, in a much
better frame of mind than he had arrived in, the
head coach went to the telephone and called up
Dudley Hall. The telephone there was in Mr.
Austin’s room, and when the chemistry instructor
came to the line Mr. Payson said: “Is that you,
Mr. Austin? This is Payson. I want very much
to get hold of Tooker. Is there any way you can
get him to the ’phone without much trouble? You
can? Thank you very much. Yes, I’ll hold the
line.”</p>

<small>NED EARNS A QUARTER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Walking,” replied Ned the next morning
with enthusiasm, “is the very best
thing I do. As our English cousins say,
I’m awfully keen about it. When do we go and
whither?”</p>

<p>“I thought we might start right after church
service and tramp over to Lloyd. Payson says
there is a good place to eat over there.”</p>

<p>“All right. That suits me.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure you weren’t going to do something
else?” asked Dan. “We aren’t likely to get
back much before supper, you know.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t going to do a thing, Vinton. If I
had been I’d give it up, because on a dandy day
like this there’s nothing finer than a good tramp
in the country. I’ll get into a pair of easier shoes,
though, I guess.” Ned observed his patent
leather Oxfords disapprovingly. “And I’ll meet
you outside Clarke at eleven-ten sharp.”</p>

<p>And so at a quarter-past eleven Dan and Ned
took the road together. Each had togged himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
in an old suit of knickerbockers and had put on a
pair of good stout, easy shoes. The morning was
just what one might expect in early November
after a day of rain. There was a bright blue sky
overhead, a wealth of golden sunshine and a little
breeze from the southwest that held a tang of the
sparkling Sound. After they had crossed the
bridge over the river and taken the inland road
that led to Broadwood, they had the broad marsh
on their right. The marsh this morning was a
wonderful far-stretching expanse of faded green
and russet and gold and red, with, here and there,
a brilliant blue ribbon of water winding across.
On their left as they trudged over the road made
firm by the rain, was a hillside of maples and
beeches. The storm had almost stripped the former
of their scarlet livery, but the beeches were
still brightly yellow, while the ground was thickly
carpeted with the fallen maple leaves.</p>

<p>For the first mile or so Ned did most of the
talking, rattling along unceasingly of every subject
under the sun, drawing Dan’s attention to a
bit of landscape or a brilliant burst of color between
whiles. Infrequently a carriage or motor
passed them, but for the most of the way they had
the curving road to themselves. At the Old Cider
Mill, Dan’s memory turned to the time the spring
before when a number of them had gone over to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Broadwood late at night and perpetrated an April
fool joke on the rival school. He mentioned it to
Ned, and Ned said:</p>

<p>“Tell me about that lark. I never got the
rights of it. You needn’t mention names, you
know.”</p>

<p>So Dan recounted the adventure and told how
he had tried to keep Gerald in ignorance of the
project for fear the boy would insist on going.
“I didn’t want him to, you see, because I felt sort
of responsible to his father.” And how, when
they had reached the mill, they had paused to eat
some sandwiches they had brought along, and had
looked up the road in the moonlight and seen
someone coming. “We went inside to wait for
him to go by. But he didn’t pass and after a
while we peeked out and there he was sitting over
there eating up the sandwiches. And when we got
out it was Gerald himself! He had found out
about it and played ’possum until we had started
and then followed us.”</p>

<p>“And didn’t the gardener over at Broadwood
hear you and chase you off the place?”</p>

<p>“He did. And he saw Gerald and recognized
him and came over and pointed him out to Collins.
We had a merry chase through the shrubbery
and over the wall. The gardener chap got
mixed up with my foot once when he was chasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Gerald and took a header. I fancy it didn’t improve
his temper any.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know anything about it until I got
home,” said Ned. “Then my dad passed the
morning paper over to me and pointed out the
story they had about it. Of course he suspected
me of having a hand, but I proved a clean bill
of health. It’s funny, Vinton, they never tried to
get back at us for that trick.”</p>

<p>“They haven’t enough ingenuity,” replied Dan.
“Perhaps, though, they’ll think up some scheme
by next first of April.” He chuckled. “I’ll
never forget the way that strip of white cloth
looked in the moonlight up there that night. We
planted it square in front of Knowles Hall. It’s
a wonder someone didn’t see us.”</p>

<p>“What was it you put on the sign? I’ve forgotten.”</p>

<p>“Alf Loring got that up, I think. It was:
‘Father, is this a school?’ ‘No, my son, it is
Broadwood.’ ‘O you April Fools!’”</p>

<p>“That was a hot one,” laughed Ned. “I guess
that sunk in! I’ll bet they were snorting mad.”</p>

<p>“They were. And poor Gerald had to go on
probation for a dickens of a time. So did Thompson,
later. I had to explain things to Gerald’s
father, which wasn’t much fun.”</p>

<p>“What sort is the old man?” Ned asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s a dandy. And he isn’t really old.
You’ve seen him, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Once when he came up to the school and spoke
to us in the hall. I didn’t remember him very
well.”</p>

<p>“He got home Friday. Gerald wanted me to go
to dinner at Sound View to-day, but I begged off.
There’s a kid who has improved since he came
to Yardley. You don’t remember him two years
ago, do you?”</p>

<p>“Only dimly. I don’t know him very well. I
used to think he was a bit stuck-up, but several
fellows have told me I was wrong.”</p>

<p>“You were,” replied Dan earnestly. “Gerald’s
just as decent a chap as there is in school, and
I’m not saying that because he’s my roommate or
because I sort of brought him up. But I will acknowledge
that he wasn’t very promising when
he first came. His father had pretty nearly
spoiled him without realizing it a bit. But Yardley
is a great place to take the nonsense out of
a fellow. Gerald had his troubles for a while and
then, having plenty of common sense, he took a
tumble and knuckled down.”</p>

<p>“I ran across quite a character the other day,”
said Ned. “I guess it was two or three weeks
ago now. A fellow named Burtis.”</p>

<p>“Burtis? I met him. He came to my room one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
night just after school opened and told me to put
him down on the list of football candidates, or
something like that. I remember it tickled Gerald
and me to death. But he was rather a smart-looking
chap, as I recall him. How’s he getting
on?”</p>

<p>“Oh, having his troubles too, Vinton. We all
do at first, I guess. But he will make good, unless
I’m very much mistaken. I’m showing him
golf just at present.”</p>

<p>“By the way, you fellows played Broadwood
the other day, I hear. How did you come out?”</p>

<p>“They won three out of five. They’ve got a
pretty good team. Golf is one of their strong
suits.”</p>

<p>“They do some things fairly well,” Dan allowed.
Then, after a pause, and with a smile,
he went on: “Funny, isn’t it, how rabid we are
at first; when we’re juniors, say? I used to think
that the Broadwood chaps were a lot of thugs
and assassins. My patriotism was absolutely
murderous! After a while you meet some of the
Greenies and it’s quite a shock to discover that
they’re really a very decent lot of fellows, not
much different from your own crowd.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Ned agreed. “I remember once
when I was a youngster here; it was my second
year, I think; I went home on the train with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Broadwood fellows. They sat across the car from
me. I really expected them to be a lot of bounders
and instead of that they were a fine-looking set
and behaved themselves all the way to New York.
As you said, it was something of a shock. And
there’s the school, by the way. You can just see
a corner of a building through the trees.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see. That’s the gym, I think. They’ve
got a mighty good location for a school, haven’t
they?”</p>

<p>“Nice and high, but too far from the water.
Here’s where we turn off, isn’t it? What’s the
sign board say?”</p>

<p>“‘Lloyd 3½ miles,’” Dan read. “We’re almost
halfway, then. It hasn’t seemed far. How
are your legs?”</p>

<p>“Just getting limbered up,” replied Ned
stoutly. “And it’s only a little after twelve. We
can make it by half-past one without hurrying, I
guess. Forward, brave comrade!”</p>

<p>The new road, which led northward at right
angles from the turnpike, was narrower and offered
harder walking, but they made good time
and at one o’clock were out on the Saybrook road
with their destination only a mile distant. Lloyd
was a tiny hamlet at the intersection of two main
lines of travel, but it was a pretty, old-fashioned
place, with huge elms drooping over comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
white houses and many tiny gardens still vivid
with autumn flowers: phlox and nasturtiums and
cosmos. The railroad passed Lloyd fully a mile
away, but for all that the hotel when they reached
it was by no means deserted, a fact readily explained
by the four or five automobiles standing
in front or in the little yard at the side. It was
a rambling white building with a veranda running
along in front, and a swinging sign hung from a
big elm at the corner. “Washington’s Head” was
the original legend on the board, and under it
was a weather-faded likeness of the Father of his
Country. But, so the story went, a visiting artist,
finding, perhaps, time heavy on his hands, had
some years before turned the capital H into a
D, so that now the sign informed the world at
large that “Washington’s Dead.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how you feel,” said Ned as they
went up the steps, “but I’m starved to death.”</p>

<p>“I feel a bit hungry myself,” acknowledged
Dan. “I wonder if dinner is ready.”</p>

<p>It was, and after washing the marks of the road
from their hands and faces they graciously allowed
the proprietor of the inn to conduct them
to their seats in the dining-room. What followed
after may be left to the imagination. There was
an old-fashioned vegetable soup to start with of
which Ned remarked that they had managed to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
everything into it save the kitchen stove. And
then there was fish and roast chicken and vegetables
and apple fritters and salad and ice cream
and lemon pie and cake and cheese and crackers
and coffee. And if Ned missed a single item or
Dan allowed anything to get by him I have been
grossly misinformed. And afterwards they struggled
out to the veranda, sank into two chairs,
placed their heels on the rail and stared somnolently
across the street at a funny little old
story-and-a-half house almost hidden by shrubbery
and box hedges. There was little conversation
for a while. The sun was nice and warm,
the breeze was broken by the corner of the
veranda and life was very blissful and sleepy.
Finally,</p>

<p>“I suppose we ought to start back before long,”
murmured Ned drowsily.</p>

<p>“Yes.” Dan lifted his eyelids and nodded
lazily. Then he shut his eyes again and returned
to a condition halfway between slumber and wakefulness.</p>

<p>“Good night,” muttered Ned. Later by ten
minutes,</p>

<p>“How many of those fritters did you eat?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Four,” replied Dan, this time without opening
his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“I only had three,” said Ned regretfully. “I
think I’ll go back.”</p>

<p>“Too late, too late!” murmured Dan. “Ye cannot
enter now!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps if we hang around here they’ll give
us five o’clock tea.”</p>

<p>Dan groaned. “Not if I’m strong enough to
resist,” he said. “What time is it?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you a watch?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I can’t get at it.”</p>

<p>“That’s my case exactly.”</p>

<p>Five minutes afterwards Ned remarked weakly:
“I think it’s about a quarter-past three.”</p>

<p>“We ought to be going,” sighed Dan.</p>

<p>“We ought,” groaned Ned. After that silence
fell again.</p>

<p>But presently a motor began to throb around
the corner of the house and a big touring car,
dusty and dirty, backed up to the curb before
the door. The two boys opened their eyes with
sighs and frowns and watched. A party of two
men and two ladies emerged from the hotel. The
man at the wheel of the car called to them:</p>

<p>“See if you can find someone to bring that suitcase
out, Jim,” he said. “It’s in front of the
desk there.”</p>

<p>Ned’s chair came down with a bang and he
jumped to his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir; right away, sir!” he said briskly. In
a moment he had dashed into the office and out
again, bearing a big leather suitcase. Dan’s chair
came down and he stared in bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Where shall I put it, sir?” Ned was asking
solicitously.</p>

<p>“Stick it in back there, my boy. That’s it.”</p>

<p>Ned deposited the bag, swung the tonneau door
open and stood respectfully at attention while
the party seated themselves. The man at the
wheel put his hand into his pocket, selected a coin
and handed it back.</p>

<p>“Here you are, boy,” he said.</p>

<p>Ned touched his forehead sketchily, “Thank
you, sir!”</p>

<p>The car bounded forward and Ned, grinning delightedly,
danced up the steps.</p>

<p>“I’ve made a quarter! I’ve made a quarter!”
he chanted.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">“You’re the craziest chap I ever saw,”
laughed Dan. “Is it a good one?”</p>

<p>Ned tried it with his teeth, tapped it
on the edge of the railing and eyed it anxiously.
“Perfectly good,” he replied finally. “It seems
to be made of silver.”</p>

<p>“Thought it might be a lead quarter,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“Fever near, sir; fever near!”</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>“I said fever near.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“That’s a phrase of reassurance spoken in my
new universal language.”</p>

<p>“Your new <em>what</em>?”</p>

<p>“Universal language,” replied Ned gravely,
seating himself on the railing. “It’s away ahead
of Esperanto, while as for Volapuk—why, Volapuk’s
dead and buried. The beauty of my system—”</p>

<p>“What do you call it?”</p>

<p>Ned’s hesitation was infinitesimal, and he answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
without the flicker of an eyelash. “Tookeranto.
As I was saying, its greatest beauty is
its simplicity. You merely change the first letters
of your words; I think transpose is the word I
should have used. For instance, I say to you,
‘That’s a pice shair of noes you have,’ and you
understand me at once.”</p>

<p>“The dickens I do!” Dan laughed.</p>

<p>“You don’t? But you would get me if I told
you you were pitting on the sorch of the Hashington’s
Wead?”</p>

<p>“Once more, please, and give me something
easier,” begged Dan.</p>

<p>“Very well; set me lee. I suppose you know
that you had choast ricken for dinner?”</p>

<p>“Roast chicken! But how the dickens do
you do it so quickly? I’d have to think an
hour.”</p>

<p>“Hink a thour, you mean,” Ned corrected.
“It’s serfectly pimple. It pomes with cractice.”</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake, shut up!” laughed Dan.
“You’ll have me crazy. It’s a wonderful language,
though. I shall study it. Have you written
a book about it yet?”</p>

<p>“Yot net,” replied Ned, shaking his head, “but
I’m toing go. When I do I shall dedicate it to
Van Dinton.”</p>

<p>Dan put his hands to his ears and jumped up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
“Come on,” he cried, “and let me take you home
before you get any worse!”</p>

<p>“You mean,” began Ned gravely.</p>

<p>“<em>No, I don’t!</em> Shut up! Have we paid for
dinner yet? I’ve eaten so much I’ve forgotten
what has happened.”</p>

<p>“We have not. Let’s find mine host and settle
up.”</p>

<p>“Now I know why you worked so hard for that
tip. You’re going to help pay for your dinner
with it.”</p>

<p>“That quarter? Never! Do you realize, sir,
that that is absolutely the first money I ever
earned? Is not that a beautiful thought? I
shall always keep that quarter, always treasure
it.” He slipped it into his vest pocket and patted
it fondly. “You never realize the value of
money, Vinton, until you earn it by the sweat of
your brow.”</p>

<p>“Your brow hasn’t sweated ten cents’ worth,”
laughed Dan. “Come on and let’s hunt up Mr.
Washington.”</p>

<p>“I wish,” murmured Ned regretfully when they
had each enriched the hotel exchequer with a dollar
bill, “I wish I had eaten that fourth fritter!”</p>

<p>They walked back rather more leisurely through
the late sunlight, reaching school just as twilight
descended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“I never thought,” Ned confided as they parted
in front of Clarke, “that I’d have any appetite for
supper, but, to quote our English cousins again,
I feel a bit peckish, don’t you know.”</p>

<p>“I’m hungry again myself,” Dan answered.
“I say, we had an awfully good time, didn’t we?
Let’s try it again some day, eh? Much obliged
to you, Tooker, for coming along. I suppose you
thought I was sort of crazy, but it was Payson’s
idea; he thought I needed a tramp, and so I asked
you—”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Ned gravely. “I may be a
tramp, but you needn’t throw it in my face.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry; hope I didn’t hurt your feelings.
Come and see me, will you? Come over to-night
for a while.”</p>

<p>“Not to-night, for I told Burtis I’d drop in on
him. But I’ll be around soon. Lo song.”</p>

<p>“Eh? Oh, so long. I’m crazy about your
Tookeritis—”</p>

<p>“Tookeranto, please,” Ned corrected.</p>

<p>“Whatever it is; and I’m going to study it so
I can understand what you’re saying now and
then.”</p>

<p>“Unkind, unkind!” murmured Ned sorrowfully.
“I fid you barewell, Van Dinton.”</p>

<p>Kendall had news for Ned that evening when
the latter called on him, but owing to the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
that Harold Towne was in the room he couldn’t
confide it for a time. Harold entertained a large
respect and admiration for Ned Tooker, and
whenever he was on hand on the occasions of
Ned’s visits he always set out to make himself
agreeable. Harold’s notion of being agreeable
was to monopolize most of the conversation, carefully
selecting subjects which he believed Ned to
be interested in and rattling away on them with
an assurance that was at once irritating and
amusing. Ned detested Kendall’s roommate
heartily, but managed to be polite no matter how
much Harold’s chatter annoyed him. To-night
Harold quite surpassed himself, playing the rôle
of host from the moment of Ned’s appearance.</p>

<p>“Hello, Tooker!” Harold cried. “Awfully
glad to see you. Kendall, pull that chair around
for Tooker. Throw your cap anywhere; this is
Liberty Hall.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged, but I’ll sit here. Well, how
are things with you, Curt?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s been grinding at his books all the
afternoon,” said Harold. “I tell him he’s after
a scholarship.”</p>

<p>“Very commendable ambition,” said Ned soberly.
“I tried it myself once and came within
one of getting a Burrows. I wrote home about
it and my dad wrote back that he guessed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
was about as near as I’d ever get to making fifty
dollars. Such ingratitude was naturally discouraging
and I never tried again.”</p>

<p>Harold laughed uproariously and Ned observed
him in grave surprise.</p>

<p>“I made a quarter to-day, though,” he went on.
“Walked over to Lloyd for dinner and held a
man’s auto for him and he gave me a quarter.
Here it is. Looks all right, doesn’t it?” He
passed it to Kendall.</p>

<p>“Seems to be real money,” laughed Kendall.
“What do you mean by saying you held a man’s
auto? Looked after it for him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, held it by the bit. It was rather nervous,
you see; tried to jump out of the shafts
every time a leaf rustled.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was a horse?” said Harold.</p>

<p>“No, an automobile! a dark bay with coppery
points. It was very good-looking, too. Very
deep in the radiator, and had an arched neck and
fine quarters. This is one of them.”</p>

<p>“You’re crazy, Ned,” laughed Kendall. “<em>Was
it a horse or was it an automobile?</em>”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know, but I got a quarter. And
all I did was hold its head, bring a pail of water
for it and polish the brass. My, but it’s easy
to earn money if you know how! Want to play
some golf to-morrow?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I’d love to, if you care to bother with
me,” answered Kendall. “But I would like to
know about that horsomobile.”</p>

<p>“I’ve told you everything,” answered Ned with
dignity. “If you doubt my story, why, here’s
the quarter.”</p>

<p>“What were you doing at Lloyd?” asked
Harold. “That’s ten or twelve miles, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“It’s quite a jaunt. I was looking for mushrooms,”
answered Ned calmly.</p>

<p>“Mushrooms? What for?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I collect them. Haven’t you ever seen
my fungi? You must come over some time and
let me show them to you.”</p>

<p>“Honest, Tooker? I’d like to see them. Did
you find any to-day? Any—er—interesting
ones?”</p>

<p>“Um—a few. I got a good specimen of the
canardius antarcticus; and a few of the Washingtonii
and Danvintonii. It’s getting late for them,
though. What I was especially anxious to find
was the pufum mobilis, or rolling mushroom.
You’ve seen that, I suppose.” Harold looked
doubtful and murmured that he didn’t think he
ever had. “Really? I thought most everyone
knew the rolling mushroom. It’s called that because
it rolls along the ground.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“Rolls along the ground!” exclaimed Kendall.
“I don’t believe it!”</p>

<p>Ned smiled kindly on his ignorance. “The mobilis,”
he explained, “is one of the puff-balls, a
small, round puff-ball. It is found on hillsides.
Most puff-balls disseminate their pores—I mean
spores—by the aid of the wind, remaining where
they grow. But the mobilis as soon as it attains
maturity detaches itself from its stalk and begins
to roll. As I have said, they always grow on the
sides of hills. Consequently they roll to the bottom,
sowing their spores as they go. We always
look along the foot of a hill until we find the dead
mobilis. Then we know that we shall find growing
ones further up.”</p>

<p>“Jimminy, that’s quite interesting!” exclaimed
Harold. “Do you know, I rather think I’ll go in
for mushrooms myself! It must be lots of fun
collecting them.”</p>

<p>“Not bad,” replied Ned. “But of course
there’s always the element of danger.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” Harold asked.</p>

<p>“Well, there are certain kinds that are poisonous
not only to touch but to approach. There’s
the leoparditus, for instance, a large, angry mushroom—although
it would be more correct to give
it the popular name of toadstool—that has a purplish
body with small livid spots on it. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
leoparditus is certain death if you touch it. Even
if you only inhale its noxious fumes”—Ned
choked a little there—“noxious fumes you will
break out with a very painful rash all over the
body, more especially the exposed portions. Then
there is the Gumponicum eachewupus, which hides
in the deep woods and springs out at you as
you unsuspectingly pass. Its bite is certain
death.”</p>

<p>Ned paused and stared gravely at the drop-light.
There was a moment of silence. Then
Kendall began to chuckle and Harold got rather
red in the face.</p>

<p>“You were just stringing us, weren’t you?” he
asked, with an attempt at a laugh. “I suppose
that was pretty funny, Tooker.”</p>

<p>“Far be it from me to praise my own efforts,”
replied Ned modestly. “You asked me what I
was doing at Lloyd. As I didn’t care to tell you
the truth and am far too polite to request you to
mind your own business I did the best I could. I
hope you found it amusing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I knew all the time you were stringing,”
said Harold uncomfortably.</p>

<p>“Your penetration, Mr. Towne,” answered Ned
graciously, “is most remarkable.” Then he began
to talk golf to Kendall, and five minutes later
Harold said he had promised to see a fellow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
took his departure. Ned heaved a sigh of relief
when the door had closed behind him.</p>

<p>“I can’t stand that fellow,” he said. “He gets
me so nervous!”</p>

<p>Kendall laughed. “I don’t mind him as much
as I did,” he said. “He means well enough, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“All right in his way, but doesn’t weigh
enough,” replied Ned flippantly. “Well, out
with it, Curt.”</p>

<p>“Out with what?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Whatever it is. You’ve been
fairly dying to tell me something ever since I got
here. So let’s have it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you knew,” said Kendall.
“I was just going to tell you that Mr. Collins
called me down to his study this afternoon
and—”</p>

<p>“Wait! Don’t tell me that you’re off probation!”</p>

<p>Kendall nodded. Ned made a gesture of disappointment.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that the dickens?” he exclaimed. “Just
when I was getting interested in you, too! I’ve
never been chummy with a ‘real devil’ of a fellow
before, and now you go and reform!”</p>

<p>“I haven’t reformed,” laughed Kendall. “I’ve
just been pardoned for my former sins.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah! And you’re just as wicked as you ever
were?”</p>

<p>“Just!”</p>

<p>“That’s better.” Ned sighed his relief. “I
was afraid you were a reformed character, Curt.
You see there are plenty of good, moral chaps in
school; I know dozens of them; but you’re the
first desperate character I ever got to know at all
well. And so they’ve lifted the ban, eh? Well,
that will help, won’t it? Now you’ll be free to
take up your career of crime again. Whisper,
Curt; what are you thinking of doing first? Had
any experience with bombs? They tell me bombing
is a pleasant and fairly safe amusement.
Would you mind beginning on that roommate of
yours? Incendiarism is another cute little way
in which to pass an evening. I’ve often thought
that Oxford would make a dandy blaze if you
could get it started. Have you ever seriously considered
murder? So many of our prominent citizens
are going in for murder nowadays. And I
can think of so many beautiful subjects for your
attentions. Why, one needn’t look beyond his
immediate acquaintances!”</p>

<p>“I’m going to try and get back on the Football
Team the first thing,” said Kendall.</p>

<p>“Seriously?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Of course, I couldn’t make the First<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Team now; it’s too late, I guess; but I might make
the Second. What do you think?”</p>

<p>“I admire your courage. But I regret that you
choose football when you might play golf. I was
going to make a gandy dolfer out of you, Curt.”</p>

<p>“I can play golf after the football season,” said
Kendall.</p>

<p>“Um; yes; but the two sciences are widely opposed.
I’ve never known a football man who
could swing a golf club decently. Football seems
to—to deaden the sensibilities, whatever those
may be, Curt. And a man must have sensibilities
to play a good game of golf. However, if
you are really determined, come with me.”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Kendall as Ned jumped up
and rescued his cap from the floor.</p>

<p>“To see Vinton. If there’s a chance for you
he will tell you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I wouldn’t like to do that, Ned!”</p>

<p>“You’ll do as I tell you! I’m going to make
something out of you or bust. If you won’t be a
golfer you shall be a footballer. Come on and
I’ll make arrangements.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>UNDER THE MANAGEMENT OF MR. TOOKER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Vinton, I want to present to you Mr. Bendall
Kurtis,” announced Ned. “Mr. Kurtis
desires to join your aggregation of thugs
and pursue the agile pigskin across the—the
verdant meed. Not bad, what?”</p>

<p>They had found Dan alone in Number 28, studying
some new plays which were to be taught to
the team that week.</p>

<p>“Very poetic,” laughed Dan. “Sit down, fellows.
Burtis and I have met before, I think.
Now kindly tell me all over again, Tooker; what
is troubling you?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing. And please don’t assume that
air of patient fortitude, as though you were humoring
an idiot from sheer politeness. I’m talking
perfectly good sense. Mr. Kurtis—or Burtis—wishes
to join your team of footballers.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. But isn’t it a little late, Burtis?”
asked Dan with a smile.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know it is,” said Kendall. “I—I
didn’t want to bother you, but Ned insisted that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
I should come over. I thought perhaps I might
be able to play on the Second Team.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well, the Second is pretty well settled
now, you see, and I don’t believe—”</p>

<p>“May I interrupt?” asked Ned very courteously.
“I merely wish to say, Vinton, that you
perhaps do not realize the magnitude of the favor
I am trying to do you. Mr. Burtis here is no
common garden variety of footballer. He is—he
is a positive wonder! I have never seen him
play, nor have I ever heard him speak of his—his
prowess, but I have tried him at golf, and, while
I don’t say that he might not with patience and
perseverance, become a golfer of some ability, yet
truth compels me to acknowledge that he would
not be likely to become the United States amateur
champion. You catch the idea?”</p>

<p>“Hanged if I do!” laughed Dan.</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you see that the mere fact that
he is only an average golfer makes it more than
probable, nay, almost certain, that he is a natural-born
footballer? In other words, Vinton, if a
fellow isn’t a golfer he must be able to do something,
and what is easier to do than football?”</p>

<p>“You’re an idiot, Tooker! But I’ll see what
can be done for you, Burtis. Perhaps Staniford
may be able to take you on as a sub. You had
some training early in the season, didn’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“A little,” answered Kendall.</p>

<p>“Were you dropped or did you get tired of
it?”</p>

<p>“I—I—”</p>

<p>“Fess up, Curt. The fact is, Vinton, that this
seemingly innocent youth is one of the most depraved
characters in school. You wouldn’t suspect
it, would you? Why, man alive, he’s been
on probation for a month! Fancy that! And
that’s why he abandoned football. He had no
choice, you see.”</p>

<p>“So that was it? I’m sorry, Burtis, you
couldn’t keep on. That was hard luck, wasn’t it?
Well, I’ll speak to Staniford to-morrow; he’s captain
of the Second, you know; perhaps he will find
something for you, although, as you know, I suppose,
there are only two weeks more of football.
What’s your line, Burtis?”</p>

<p>“Line?” asked Kendall vaguely.</p>

<p>“Yes; I mean what position have you played?”</p>

<p>“My dear Vinton,” Ned interrupted before
Kendall could reply, “my client is an all-around
footballer. He can play anything from quarter-back
to manager. His—ah—domain, if I may use
the word, has no limits, Vinton; he—”</p>

<p>“Oh, please dry up, Ned,” begged Kendall
laughingly. “He will think I’m a perfect
fool!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“None of us,” replied Ned, shaking his head
sadly, “are perfect.”</p>

<p>“Well, you come down to the field to-morrow
afternoon,” said Dan to Kendall, “and we’ll see.
But don’t bring your advertising manager with
you. First thing I know he will have you captain
of the team!”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Kendall gratefully.
“Would it matter if I didn’t wear regular things
to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Regular things?” asked Dan. “What sort of
things?”</p>

<p>“I mean regular football clothes. You see, I
didn’t get any because—”</p>

<p>“You shall have mine,” exclaimed Ned. “I’ve
got a perfectly magnificent array of football attire!
I shall never use them again; they are
yours unconditionally, Curt. My football experience
was brief but lurid. Perhaps I didn’t know
as much about playing the game as some; in fact,
the coach as much as hinted that; but I will say
that when it came to outfit, Vinton, I was head and
shoulders above the whole field! Complete, that’s
the word for it. I don’t believe in doing things
by halves, and when I determined to lend my assistance
to the football team I obtained a catalogue
from a dealer in football necessities and
luxuries and bought one of everything. I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
I owned everything in any way connected with
the game except a gridiron. I even had an assortment
of leather and felt pads for my ankles,
knees, elbows and shoulders in case I should meet
with an accident some time while plunging
through the enemy’s line for a touchdown. And
I had—and still have—a rubber thing that
strapped around my head and covered my little
nose; I held one extremity of it between my pearly
teeth, and I can still remember how very unpleasant
it tasted. All these things shall be yours,
Curt. I intend you to be the Beau Brummel of
the football field. All I ask is that some day you
will allow me to dress you in full panoply, with
a complete assortment of rubber bandages, arm
and leg guards, nose guard and head guard, and
have your picture taken!”</p>

<p>They were still laughing over Ned’s extravagances
when the door opened and Gerald Pennimore
came in. He shook hands with Kendall and
seemed very glad to see him. “I thought you had
forgotten your promise to come and see us, Burtis,”
he said. “How are you, Tooker? I haven’t
seen much of you this fall.”</p>

<p>“Been over to Arthur’s?” Dan asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. He’s getting on all right. The doctor
says he can try crutches, if he likes. The sprain
wasn’t as bad as it seemed at first, he says.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who’s that, Pennimore? Arthur Thompson?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, he sprained his knee in the game last
week.”</p>

<p>“I heard about it. Too bad. I’m glad he’s
getting well, though. I suppose that keeps him
out of football for the rest of the season, doesn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Dan replied. “I hope, though, that he
will be able to hobble into the Broadwood game
for a minute so as to get his Y.”</p>

<p>“These the new plays?” asked Gerald, taking
up the sheets of paper on the table. “When I
see a thing like that I’m glad I’m not on the
team,” he laughed, holding up one of the diagrams.</p>

<p>“How is the Cross-Country Team getting on?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Fine. We have our trials to-morrow afternoon
to select the fellows to run against Broadwood
a week from Saturday. We’ve got twenty-two
fellows trying, which means that ten of us
will get left.”</p>

<p>“Ten?” said Dan. “I thought you had only
ten in the race.”</p>

<p>“That’s all, but Andy picks a dozen and two
of them are substitutes in case someone can’t run.
How are you getting on, Burtis?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“First rate, thank you.”</p>

<p>“You gave up football, didn’t you? You know
you were quite full of it a while ago.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I—that is—”</p>

<p>“He’s going to try again to-morrow,” said
Dan. “That is, if I can convince Staniford that
he needs another sub. Tooker has accepted
the position of Burtis’s press agent and manager.”</p>

<p>“I should think he’d make a good one,” said
Gerald, with a smile.</p>

<p>“One of the best,” agreed Ned. “After the
football season is over I shall be at leisure again.
Anything needed in my line?”</p>

<p>“No, I think not,” laughed Gerald.</p>

<p>After Ned and Kendall had taken their departures,
which they did a few minutes later, Gerald
turned a puzzled face to Dan.</p>

<p>“What did you mean by saying that Burtis was
going to try again?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I meant,” replied Dan ruefully, “that that
idiot Tooker came in here with Burtis and hypnotized
me into promising to get Burtis on the
Second Team if I could. Don’t ask me how it
happened, because I don’t know. But one thing
I do know,” he added as he took up the diagrams
again, “and that is that Tooker can talk you
out of house and home. I was afraid all the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
he was here that he would decide to make Burtis
captain, and that I’d have to resign.”</p>

<p>“Yesterday,” laughed Gerald, “you were aching
to resign. I’m glad you’ve changed your
mind about it, Dan. Things looking brighter to-night?”</p>

<p>“Lots, chum. That walk sort of cleared my
brain, I guess. I wonder why I never knew
Tooker better. He’s a dandy sort.”</p>

<p>In spite of Dan’s request to the contrary, Ned
accompanied Kendall to the field the next afternoon.
Kendall was clothed in Ned’s football togs,
which fitted him fairly well. In appearance they
were brand-new, for Ned’s football career had
been brief and the immaculate khaki trousers held
not the tiniest smooch. What Dan had said to
the Second Team’s captain isn’t known, although
Ned secretly wondered how the former had managed
to put such an extraordinary request. To
instate an inexperienced player even on the Second
at the tag end of the season was an outlandish
proceeding, and Ned knew that Dan had done it
only to show his appreciation of Ned’s companionship
on that walk to Lloyd. As for Kendall, it
never occurred to him to wonder about the proceeding.
He was still pretty green in such matters.
Staniford was a big, broad-shouldered First
Class fellow who took his captaincy of the Second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
very seriously and worked like a Trojan with his
fellows under him. He greeted Kendall very
briefly and sent him to the bench, but Ned noticed
with amusement that the captain’s gaze followed
Kendall with perplexity.</p>

<p>“He’s laying it to politics,” said Ned to himself
with a chuckle, “and he’s wondering what Curt
is going to do for Vinton in return. Alas, human
nature is terribly suspicious!”</p>

<p>After a while Kendall was sent onto the field
with a squad of Second Team substitutes to run
through signals. It was his first experience with
signals, and from his place at left half-back he
made so many mistakes at first that the entire
squad viewed him with disgust and resentment.
But he began to understand what was required,
and for the last five minutes of the drill acquitted
himself fairly well. But there were many who
asked that afternoon:</p>

<p>“Who’s the jay Stany put in here to-day?
Where’d he come from? What’s he think this is,
a kindergarten?”</p>

<p>From which you may gather the impression that
Kendall’s first day as a member of the Second
Team was not highly successful. The First was
walked and then trotted through two of the new
plays that afternoon, and later, when it faced the
Second, it tried them out. You can never tell on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
paper what a play will be on the field, and to-day
one of the two plays proved utterly impractical
and was immediately dropped. Altogether, that
afternoon’s practice was not a success, a fact recognized
by coaches, captain and players, and there
was a general air of discouragement apparent
afterwards. Two graduates, old football players,
had put in an appearance that day and had bothered
Payson to death with their advice and interference.
They had the best intentions in the
world and had as likely as not sacrificed time and
trouble to be there, but the amount of actual assistance
they rendered was nil. Payson growled
to Cowles, the manager, on the way up the hill,
that if he had his way there’d be a notice at
the school entrance reading, “No graduates
allowed.”</p>

<p>Kendall had watched the scrimmage from the
bench, one of two dozen or so blanket-wrapped
substitutes, none of whom he knew save by sight
and none of whom was apparently aware of his
existence. When, panting and perspiring, the
members of the opposing teams rescued their
sweaters and trotted or limped back to the gymnasium
Kendall followed, secretly proud to be
even an humble unit in that army of warriors.
He had his shower like the rest of them—Ned
having procured him a locker all his own—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
dressed slowly, listening to the talk about him and
watching the scene. Discouragement, as I have
said, was the aftermath to-day. Even the Second
Team fellows felt that the afternoon had been
practically wasted. Kendall saw Dan, at first
half undressed and then, later, swathed in a big
towel, standing for minutes at a time talking earnestly,
scowling the while, with Tom Roeder or Al
Simms or Wallace Hammel. Everyone seemed
cross and disgruntled. Mr. Payson, crossing the
room once, looked out of sorts, something very unusual
for him. Even the door when it closed behind
him seemed to slam vindictively. A tussle
over the possession of a towel which started good-naturedly
between two boys at the farther end of
the locker-room ended in a “scrap,” with friends
of the contestants thrusting them angrily apart
and showing a disposition to “start something”
themselves on the slightest provocation. Kendall,
who had climbed onto a bench to watch
events, felt a bit disappointed when the two boys
went off growling in different directions, leaving
the towel, the bone of contention, quite forgotten
on the floor. The steam from the baths eddied
out and filled the room with a humid warmth, and
from beyond the partition came the hiss of water
and the sudden shriek of a bather as the cold
stinging jets struck his glowing body. Little by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
little the babel of sound lessened. One by one,
or in groups, the fellows slammed their locker
doors and went out. Kendall, who had been ten
minutes tying a shoelace, found himself almost
alone. The lights were on now and outside the
high windows was deep twilight. He finished his
toilet, arranged his clothes in the locker, shut
the door and dropped the key in his pocket. At
the door of the stairway he turned for a final
look over the big room with its disarranged
benches, its water-stained floor, its litter of discarded
or forgotten towels and its heavy, steamy
odor. Somehow he felt that here at last was <em>life</em>!</p>

<p>That last week but one seemed to rush by.
There was Tuesday, when the Second scored on
the First by a blocked kick, and Wednesday when
the First came back and literally tore the Second
to shreds, and Thursday, when Kendall got into
the scrimmage for a brief five minutes and
emerged from what seemed afterwards to have
been a wild chaos with a black eye and bleeding
knuckles and a positive hatred of Cowles, whose
whistle had ended the fray. That was Kendall’s
baptism by fire, and it left him trembling with excitement
and eager for the morrow. By Friday
the First Team had learned its new signals; hard
nightly periods in the gymnasium had accomplished
that; and had mastered the new plays so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
that the Second Team went into the scrimmage
with no hope of scoring, but only wondering how
long they could stand off their opponents. The
First was a fighting machine at last, eleven eager,
powerful parts working together with a minimum
of friction. The Second dug their toes and
strained and panted and sweated, but always the
First came through, overwhelming them, thrusting
them aside, trampling over them to victory.
Time and again the Second was given the ball on
the First’s ten yards or five yards and told to
take it over. But the First was a human stone
wall, and Staniford almost cried as his attack
curled up like spent bullets against steel. The
First was coming fast now and discouragement
was forgotten. The school was in the throes of
the excitement that always presages the Big
Game. The first mass meeting had been held on
Wednesday; there was another called for Saturday
night. Football songs were heard everywhere.
Lessons suffered those days, and the instructors
mentally shrugged their shoulders and
patiently waited for the madness to end. And
then, on Saturday forenoon, the First Team and
almost the whole student body went off, cheered
and cheering, to Nordham for the last contest before
the final game. Kendall went, and Ned, and
Gerald, and about everyone we know except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Arthur Thompson, and all the way to Nordham
the Yardley songs and cheers floated out the car
windows:</p>

<p>“Yardley! Yardley!! Yardley!!!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>YARDLEY VISITS NORDHAM</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The Nordham game had been carefully
planned by Mr. Payson and Dan. Nordham
had this year a light-weight team with a
rather weak line and an exceptionally fast and
clever back-field. On the offensive Yardley was
to stick largely to plays between tackles, relying
on Tom Roeder and Wallace Hammel for plunges,
while Stearns, lighter but quicker, was expected
to “knife” himself through with good effect.
Ridge and Simms were to do the punting. Field
goals were outside the calculations, since no one
could be depended on to perform them with any
certainty. On defense it was planned to use the
“basket” formation, the end dropping well back
and outside the opposing flankers, the full-back
playing behind center and the quarter and the two
half-backs playing a deep field. This, which was
practically Yardley’s defense against kick formation,
was to be used regularly, since the enemy
had a reputation for being wonderfully tricky in
her back-field. The arrangement weakened the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Yardley line, but Nordham was not thought to be
heavy enough to gain by ordinary plunging
tactics.</p>

<p>The Blue started the game with the following
line-up: Vinton, left end; Mitchell, left tackle;
Ridge, left guard; Fogg, center; Merriwell, right
guard; Jensen, right tackle; Norton, right end;
Simms, quarter-back; Roeder, left half-back;
Stearns, right half-back; Hammel, full-back. It
was planned to use a number of substitutes just as
soon as the game had been “placed on ice.”
Holmes, quarter; Sayer, end; Greene and Fayette,
half-backs; Marion, full-back, and Fales,
guard, were all likely to play one or two periods.</p>

<p>Yardley won the toss and Hammel kicked off.
Nordham tried the center of the Yardley line in a
tentative way and then punted. The kick was a
beautiful one against a slight wind and almost
went over Simms’s head. The Nordham ends
came down the field like two streaks of lightning
and had little trouble getting by the interference.
Simms made four or five yards and then went
down with two Nordham players on top of him.
Simms started right in trying out the Nordham
line and Roeder and Hammel went through for
good gains. But it was necessary to punt on the
third down. Nordham opened up a bewildering
series of attacks then. She had a quick line-shift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
that was difficult to meet successfully and it soon
became evident that the formation being used by
Yardley would not meet the requirements of the
occasion. Nordham set her whole team in motion
to the right or left, as the case might be, with
the runner effectually concealed until the moment
came for him to “go in.” This had the effect
of upsetting Yardley’s formation, and twice Norton
was badly fooled. After Nordham had barely
made her distance twice, Dan and Simms held a
consultation and the “basket” formation was
abandoned, the ends playing up into the line and
the halves moving closer. That worked better,
but Nordham had a dozen tricks up her sleeve
and rattled them off so fast that Yardley began to
be dazed. Plays that started without signals,
plays in which the whole back-field moved one way
and the quarter, carrying the ball, sprang around
the opposite end; forward passes from kick formation,
forward passes from close formation, on-side
kicks and a half-dozen other plays tested the
Yardley secondary defense as it had not been
tested all the fall. Nordham’s plays were, however,
all built around two players, her quarter,
Buckman, a human eel, and her left half-back,
Lishing. Both were exceptionally fast starters,
ran like the wind, dodged miraculously and fought
like wolves when tackled. Lishing was tall and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
slim and the quarter-back was a small, wiry
youngster of seventeen, red of hair and freckled
of face. He wore no head guard and before the
game was ten minutes old the slogan on the Blue’s
side was, “<em>Look for the red head!</em>”</p>

<p>Nordham worked the ball to the middle of the
field and there a play went wrong, the runner was
thrown by Dan yards behind his line and Nordham
kicked. It was Stearns’s ball over near the
side-line and he had plenty of time to make the
catch and get started. But there was a fumble,
the Nordham left end tore down, evaded Norton
and tackled Stearns just as that youth recovered
the ball. It was Yardley’s ball on her fifteen
yards. A plunge at the Nordham left tackle netted
two yards and put the ball outside. It was
taken in fifteen yards and Roeder struck the center
of the enemy’s line for four yards. There
was no great trouble getting through the first defense,
but the secondary played good ball that day
and time and again Roeder, Hammel or Stearns
was stopped hard just when it seemed that he was
safely through. With four to go, Norton dropped
back to punt. A poor pass slowed him up and
the kick when it got off was too low. Someone,
a Nordham guard perhaps, leaped into the path
of the ball and it thudded against his body, rebounded
over the heads of the attack and trickled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
towards the Yardley goal. Half a dozen players
dived for it, but it was Lishing who, getting
through in some marvelous manner, picked it up
and romped straight over the goal-line and scored
a touchdown between the posts. Buckman kicked
an easy goal.</p>

<p>There was no more scoring in that period, although
Yardley took the ball on steady plunges
to the Nordham forty yards before the whistle
blew. In the second period a thirty-yard run by
Lishing along the side-line brought the spectators
to their feet. A moment or two later Buckman
got away around the other end and covered fifteen
before he was finally stopped. With the ball on
Yardley’s thirty yards, Nordham tried a fake kick
that netted little. Then Buckman fell back for
a try at goal from placement, although the opponents
refused to believe that it would not turn out
a fake. It was a bona fide attempt, however, and
with a few feet more elevation it would have succeeded.
As it was, the ball passed under the
crossbar, and a great sigh of relief went up from
the Yardley supporters on the stands.</p>

<p>Yardley chose to put the ball in scrimmage and
then began an advance down the field that would
not be denied. Roeder and Hammel went through
the line time and again, and once or twice Stearns
got past left tackle for good gains. Simms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
worked a quarter-back run for twelve yards and
placed the pigskin on Nordham’s twenty-five.
Then Roeder was called on and made eight
straight through center. Hammel slammed out
four more. Stearns was “knifed” past right
guard for three. Nordham rallied desperately
and Roeder was thrown back for a loss. It was
a situation calling for a good drop-kicker and Dan
gritted his teeth in helplessness. Simms was for
giving Norton a try, but Dan was afraid to risk
it. Instead a forward pass from kick formation
was tried, Simms passing to Dan at the side of
the field. But Nordham was alert and although
Dan made the catch nicely and started for the
goal-line he was tackled for small gain and the
ball went to Nordham on the twelve yards. Nordham
kicked on first down, Stearns caught in midfield
and came back seven before he was stopped.
From there Yardley again took up her advance.
Nordham replaced her left guard, but Yardley
still went through and at last, after fourteen plays
placed the ball over the line for her first score.
A punt-out gave Hammel a try for goal from the
twenty yards, but he missed badly. Nordham was
still a point ahead.</p>

<p>But now it seemed only a question of how many
more touchdowns Yardley could smash out in the
remaining time, for the Nordham line, it was evident,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
could not stop Roeder or Hammel. There
was no more scoring in that period, however, and
the two teams trotted off the field.</p>

<p>Payson had his chance to talk then, and he made
good use of it. Nordham, he predicted, would
play a kicking game for the remainder of the
contest and would try field goals whenever she
could. It was up to the Yardley ends and half-backs,
he said, to see that Nordham didn’t gain on
punting. “You’ve got to get that interference
for the catcher working, fellows. You let their
ends get by every time. You let them fool you.
Run them out and don’t try to spill them until
you can accomplish something. Norton, and you
too, Roeder, you go for them too near the line.
Several times you’ve upset those ends and they’ve
picked themselves up again and gone on down the
field in time to stop the runner. I’ve taught you
a good interference for the man who’s running
the ball back. Now make it go! And one thing
more, and this is for all of you fellows; keep your
eye on the ball. Don’t think you know what the
play is going to be; don’t try to guess it; <em>watch
the ball every minute</em>! I’ve been hammering that
into you all the fall. If you don’t learn to do
it now you’ll have mighty slim chances of winning
from Broadwood next week.”</p>

<p>“Could we use a couple of the new plays, sir?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
asked Simms. “That delayed pass might work
well near goal.”</p>

<p>“No, Simms, not with four Broadwood scouts
in the stands,” replied the coach dryly. “You’ve
got plenty of plays if you make them go. Stick
to those. And don’t try forward passes inside the
twenty-five yards, Simms; these fellows are too
knowing for that. Plug the line and wear it out.”</p>

<p>The third period was the hardest fought of any.
Yardley made good gains through the Nordham
line until the twenty-five yards was reached.
Then Nordham, playing close formation, twice
held her for downs. Had Yardley had a player
who could have kicked an easy field goal the game
would have been decided then and there. Nordham
invariably punted out of danger on first
down, and, with what wind there was still favoring
her, got off kicks of forty-five and fifty
yards. It was discouraging to peg half the length
of the field and then be turned back on the very
threshold. But that is just what happened to the
visitors twice. But finally the tide of fortune
turned.</p>

<p>Nordham, gaining the ball on a fumble by Hammel
near the middle of the field, kicked for forty
yards. Simms gathered the pigskin in, recovered
seven yards before he was thrown and then
worked an on-side kick that, quite unexpected by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Nordham, was recovered by Dan for a gain of
thirty yards.</p>

<p>Roeder tore off ten yards on one try and Hammel
got six. Roeder made four and Stearns got
through for first down. Roeder, who had been
worked pretty hard, showed signs of wear and
Fayette took his place. Stearns got by left tackle
for six yards and Simms went five on a wide end
run. Fayette gained two through center and
Stearns was stopped on an attempt at the left
end. Hammel, on a double pass, made first down
through right guard. The ball was now down
near the enemy’s twenty yard line and near the
side of the field. Hammel got around on the
short side of the field for twelve but was called
back seven as he had stepped over the line.
Simms tried a wide run around the other end and
made less than a yard. The ball was opposite the
goal and Hammel crashed through for five and
made it first down. Fayette got three on a “skin-tackle”
play and Stearns made four in the same
place. Hammel was given the ball then for a
straight plunge at left guard and got through and
staggered over the goal line for the second touchdown.
Dan took the ball out and tried goal, but
missed it by inches. The score stood 10 to 6
in Yardley’s favor. Nordham kicked off from
midfield and Simms came back twelve before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
opposing ends reached him. Then the whistle
blew.</p>

<p>It was not advisable to make all the substitutions
originally planned, but Mr. Payson sent
Holmes in for Simms at quarter, Sayer for Dan
and Marion for Hammel. Two minutes after the
final period commenced Nordham, from a kick
formation, sent her full-back around Sayer for
twenty yards and the stands shrieked and howled.
A plunge at Merriwell was repulsed and Buckman,
Nordham’s diminutive quarter-back,
squirmed through between Ridge and Mitchell and
made seven before he was rudely sat on. It took
the youngster two minutes to recover from that
experience.</p>

<p>The ball was on Yardley’s thirty-eight yards
and near the side of the field. With one of her
running plays in which Buckman, carrying the
pigskin, was hidden behind the line, Nordham
placed the ball five yards nearer the goal-line and
directly in front of the crossbar. A half-back
knelt on the turf and Buckman retreated for a
place-kick. The pass was good and although the
entire Yardley line came crashing through desperately,
Buckman lifted the ball neatly over the
bar for three more points. With the score 10 to
9, Yardley settled down to add another touchdown.
Stearns was injured slightly on the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
play and was taken out. Greene took his place.
The back-field was now much weaker, for neither
Greene nor Fayette could make the holes that
Roeder and Stearns had made. Marion, at full-back,
was a dependable line-bucker and it was he
who made most of the gains for the next five minutes,
gains which finally took the ball past the middle
of the field and into Nordham territory again.
But unfortunately it was also Marion whose fumble
on the Nordham forty-five yard line gave the
ball to the enemy. On the first play Sayer was
again drawn in and Lishing romped around the
Blue’s left end for eighteen yards amidst the wild
applause of Nordham partisans. Buckman tried
the left of the opposing line for a yard, the full-back
squirmed through for three and then came
one of Nordham’s quick shifts and a forward pass
across the field to the right end who had managed
to run over undetected. That was a hair-raising
moment. The end had a clear field ahead of him
save for Simms who was down near the twenty
yards. But Ridge showed a burst of speed and
reached the runner near the thirty yard line and
threw him hard out of bounds. The ball was
brought in and it was Nordham’s first down on
the thirty. It was naturally to be expected that
Nordham would try an end run, either to place
the ball in front of goal or to advance it down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the short side of the field. But she didn’t. The
interference swept to the right, toward middle
of the field, and Buckman plunged straight ahead
for six yards. The Nordham cheers were deafening
now. Along the side-line Mr. Payson and Dan
paced, Dan scowling and the coach imperturbable.
With four to go, Nordham seemingly elected to try
a field goal on second down. The angle was extreme,
although the distance was only about
twenty-five yards. But it was a fake. The half-back
who caught the ball started for a run toward
the middle of the field. The opponent, however,
was on guard and he was dropped by Sayer for
a loss of three yards. But the ball was fairly
opposite the posts and again Buckman stepped
back and again the half knelt on the turf.</p>

<p>“Block it!” shrieked Ridge, who was field captain.
“Get through and block this kick!”</p>

<p>It was Ridge himself who barely tipped the ball
as it sailed away from Buckman’s toe and went
straight over the center of the bar. Pandemonium
broke loose in the Nordham camp and the
Nordham players jumped and cavorted gleefully.
There was less than four minutes of time left. In
that four minutes Yardley worked the ball for
fifty yards without losing it once, her backs slamming
at the Nordham line with the desperation
born of despair. And almost under the shadow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
of the goal posts, when another four or five downs
might have saved the day, the whistle blew!</p>

<p>“Nordham 12, Opponents 10,” said the score
board. Yardley had met her second defeat.</p>

<p class="cap">“But this paper,” said Gerald, kicking the
offending sheet from the window seat to
the floor, “says Nordham outplayed us. I
don’t think that’s fair. Do you, sir?”</p>

<p>“Well, didn’t they outplay us, Pennimore?”
asked Mr. Payson who had dropped into Number
28 for a visit after church. “They won, and there
were no flukes that I saw.”</p>

<p>“But if we’d kicked the goals after our touchdowns—”</p>

<p>“But we didn’t, and they outplayed us right
there. There’s no use being disgruntled and trying
to deceive yourselves into thinking that it
was a case of hard luck, for it wasn’t. What do
you say, Vinton?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose they outplayed us,” answered
Dan wearily. “We were away ahead of them at
straight football, but—”</p>

<p>“‘Straight football,’” repeated the coach with
a smile. “By that you mean bucking the line,
I suppose. But that isn’t any ‘straighter’ than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
any other sort of football nowadays, Vinton. No,
sir, Nordham has a remarkable team, a team built
around two fast backs and weak in the line, to be
sure, but I take my hat off to that coach over
there. And to that quarter of theirs, too. He’s
a little marvel, Vinton.”</p>

<p>“Wish we had him,” muttered Dan.</p>

<p>“Um; if we had we’d have to make our team
over. Of course Nordham had this advantage
over us yesterday; they could play to their limit,
since their big game is two weeks off, while we
were obliged to hold back our best plays on account
of Broadwood. She had at least four assistant
coaches and players there yesterday, but
I don’t think they learned much.”</p>

<p>“They’ll eat us up next Saturday,” sighed Dan
moodily.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, but I don’t think so. If they played
the sort of game Nordham plays they might beat
us, for we haven’t learned a defense against a
running game. But Broadwood must play about
the sort of game we played yesterday. Her backs
are heavy, line-smashing fellows and Saturday’s
game will be pretty much all what you just called
‘straight football.’ On the whole, Vinton, we
didn’t do so badly to hold Nordham to three scores
yesterday. She might have run us off our feet
with that tricky game of hers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>“Has Broadwood some good kickers this year?”
asked Gerald.</p>

<p>“She’s still got Rhodes,” said Dan. “You remember
him last year, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe,” said the coach, “that we need
fear goals from field. They’ve only scored two
all season.”</p>

<p>“One of those was a fluke,” added Dan.</p>

<p>“What we’ve got to watch out for are forward
passes. They’ve been getting off some fine ones
lately. They gained eighty yards in the Forest
Hill game by forward passes. How is Stearns
this morning?”</p>

<p>“A bit lame,” replied Dan. “He will be all
right to-morrow, I guess.”</p>

<p>“We’ll let him lay off to-morrow. It will be
light work for all unless this weather changes.
It’s almost like summer to-day. Well, I must be
getting back. How are you feeling, Vinton?”</p>

<p>“All right,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“How’s the ankle?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was just a twist. It feels pretty good
to-day.”</p>

<p>“Well, go easy on it and give it a good rubbing
to-night. We got through yesterday very well as
far as injuries go. Going to lick Broadwood
cross-country Saturday, Pennimore?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, hard,” answered Gerald with conviction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
“We’ve got a dandy team this year. Ryan
picked the fellows last week.”</p>

<p>“Glad to hear it. That will mean two defeats
for the Green on Saturday. Well, I’ll see you to-morrow,
Vinton. Good morning.”</p>

<p>The next afternoon, as the weather still held
warm, all those who had played for more than a
period in the Nordham game were sent around
the track a few times and then discharged for the
day. But there was a hard battle between the
First Team substitutes and the Second Team, and
Kendall got into it for a whole ten-minute period.
I can’t say that he especially distinguished himself,
although he worked as hard as he knew how.
But there were a great many fine points about
the duties of a half-back that Kendall had never
heard of, and it seemed to him that he came in
for more than his share of criticism. The two
teams battled through three ten-minute periods
without a score on either side.</p>

<p>On Tuesday hard work began again and Mr.
Payson sought to correct some of the faults shown
in the Nordham contest. The two-day rest had
brought the players around in fine shape and
the spirit shown argued well for the team’s success.
Only Dan was disappointing that day. He
was badly off his game and seemed in a very low
frame of mind. Mr. Payson watched him closely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and so did Andy Ryan, the trainer. The coach
trusted that he would pull around by the morrow,
but on Wednesday, the final day of real work, Dan
was still listless and dumpy. After supper that
evening Mr. Payson dropped into Number 28
Clarke again.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said Dan, who was half-heartedly going
over his Greek, “I was just going down to see
you.”</p>

<p>“I thought I’d save you the trouble. Good
evening, Pennimore. How are you?”</p>

<p>“Very well, thank you, sir. I wish Dan felt as
well.”</p>

<p>Dan frowned. “There’s nothing wrong with
me, Gerald, so please cut it out.”</p>

<p>“You don’t look terribly bright and cheerful,”
said Mr. Payson smilingly. “Sleeping all right?”</p>

<p>“Pretty fair,” answered Dan.</p>

<p>“He’s fibbing, sir,” said Gerald. “He was
awake about half of last night. Twice I woke up
and found him reading.”</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake, Gerald, mind your own
business,” said Dan crossly. “I’m no baby.
What if I did read a while? I wasn’t sleepy.”</p>

<p>“Well, but that won’t do, Vinton, and you know
it as well as I do,” said Mr. Payson quietly. “We
can’t have you getting nervous now. Too much
depends on your being in good shape Saturday.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll be all right, sir,” answered Dan impatiently.</p>

<p>“Of course. Well, let’s talk about to-morrow if
you have time. I suppose we’ll have to go
through the motions of practice for the sake of
the school, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir,” said Dan. “They’re going to
march down to the field as usual and shout themselves
hoarse. There was some talk of having the
band up.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll call practice for four o’clock then.
That’ll give us fifteen or twenty minutes of it.
And that reminds me.” He took out a memorandum
book and made a note in it. “I’m going
to have Fogg and Girard go down early and practice
passing to Simms and Holmes. Fogg was
a bit ragged Saturday.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” said Dan. “And Norton
ought to have a good half hour at goal practice.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have him try a few kicks, Vinton, but
I don’t want to shove him too hard. We’ve got
the fellows just about on edge and some of them,
fellows like Norton, are likely to go over if we
push them too much. But I guess a couple of
dozen drop-kicks won’t hurt him. I hope, though,
that we won’t have to rely on Norton to score. I
think that by next fall he will be a pretty good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
drop-kicker, if he’s willing to keep at it and practice.”</p>

<p>“I wish he could do it now,” said Dan bitterly.
“With all the fellows in this school it certainly
seems as if there might be one able to lift the
ball over the goal once out of ten times!”</p>

<p>“It does seem so, and that’s a fact,” Mr. Payson
agreed. “I don’t believe I ever knew of a
team so weak in the kicking department of the
game. It’s largely my fault, of course, but I had
no idea that Hammel was going to peter out as
he has. Last year he was full of promise. However,
we’re no worse off than Broadwood. And I
daresay that if we get the ball within field goal
distance we can shove it over by rushing.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to,” said Dan dryly.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so. Well, Cowles is coming down
to see me this evening and I’ll have to go on.
By the way, Vinton, how would you like to take
a vacation to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“A vacation?” asked Dan in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes. I mean pack your bag and run off somewhere
to-morrow after practice and stay until Saturday
morning. You aren’t needed here and it
will do you a lot of good to get away from things
for a couple of nights. You’ll sleep better, for
one thing, and eat better, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw, I don’t want to do that! I’m all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
right, sir. I’ll sleep like a top to-night. Besides,
I’d worry more away than if I was here where I
could watch things.”</p>

<p>“There won’t be anything to watch,” said Mr.
Payson with a smile. “Think it over, Vinton. It
would be the best thing for you and for the team.
We’ll talk about it to-morrow. Good night.”</p>

<p>“Anybody would think I was dying from the
way he talks,” said Dan irritably when the coach
had gone. “That would be a fine idea, wouldn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Gerald.</p>

<p>“Why, to go off and leave things just before
the game!”</p>

<p>“I think it would be a mighty good idea,” replied
Gerald firmly. “And I wish you’d do it,
Dan.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not going to! Payson won’t get
me away from here unless he steals me, I can tell
you that!”</p>

<p>And that was Dan’s answer the next day when
the coach brought the subject up again, although
Dan put it more politely. Mr. Payson said, “Just
as you say, Vinton,” and changed the subject,
and Dan, who had slept about four hours out of
nine, told himself aggrievedly that Payson didn’t
care whether he was all right or not!</p>

<p>But Payson did care, and he had been doing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
good deal of thinking and some acting, as Dan was
to discover.</p>

<p>The entire school marched to the field that afternoon
and cheered and sang for the better part
of two hours. The band didn’t come, but it
wasn’t missed. The First Team went through
ten minutes of signal work, did some punting and
catching and then retired. After that the substitutes
played a ten-minute game with the Second.
It wasn’t much of a contest, but nobody
cared. Enthusiasm reigned and from the stands
came football songs and cheers. When the whistle
blew the Second Team gathered together and
cheered the First, and the First Team substitutes
cheered the Second, and the last day of practice
was over. The spectators formed in line of
march again and tramped back up the hill to the
gymnasium, still singing, in the wake of the
players:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>In front of the gymnasium the crowd gathered
and began the cheers for the players. “Rah, rah,
rah! Rah, rah, rah! Rah, rah, rah! Vinton!”
Then Ridge, and Hammel, and Simms and so on
down to the last substitute. And then, “Three
cheers for Coach Payson, fellows, and make it
good!” And after that three cheers for Andy
Ryan, and finally, “Now, fellows, nine times three
for the Team!” And after that, with hoarse but
undiscouraged voices, a long cheer for “Yardley!
<em>Yardley!!</em> YARDLEY!!!” And then, still singing,
the procession wound around the front of the
buildings and stopped in front of Oxford and gave
a cheer for the Principal. (The mere fact that
Doctor Hewitt was away for the winter made no
difference. They were following the custom.)
And then more cheers, and much laughter, and
some horseplay, and the throng broke up to descend
presently on the supper tables and sweep
them clear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>At nine there was a mass meeting in the Assembly
Hall and the enthusiasm began again. Mr.
Payson spoke and was cheered to the echo, and
Mr. Collins spoke and was cheered just as liberally,
and then there came a loud, insistent demand
for “Vinton! We want Vinton!” And
after a moment Mr. Payson arose and announced
that the captain was not present this evening and
that he thought it would be a good idea to hear
from the quarter-back. Simms tried to escape,
but was captured after a struggle and lifted none
too gently onto the stage, where he stood and
viewed the audience helplessly for a full minute,
very much embarrassed indeed. And the more
embarrassed he got the more they laughed and
the louder they cheered. Desperation brought ingenuity.
One moment Simms was there and the
next he was gone! A sudden dash across the
stage to the door of the dressing-room and he
was free! Howls of glee filled the hall, and some
of the fellows near the entrance started up in pursuit,
but were discouraged by older heads.</p>

<p>Ridge, who was a good talker, and whom the
fellows all liked, took Simms’s place and spoke
for a few minutes. After that the football songs
were practiced, the Banjo and Mandolin Club supplying
accompaniment. Finally, with a last resounding
cheer, the meeting broke up, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
members clattering down the stairs and out of the
building still singing. Then the cry for Vinton
was renewed and was taken up by two hundred
throats: “We want Vinton. We want Vinton!
We want Vinton!” Presently the throng swirled
over to the front of Clarke and the cry was
hurled up at the lighted window of Number 28.
But the football captain didn’t appear and a half-dozen
fellows rushed up the stairs in search of
him. But they were soon back, for the room was
empty. So they cheered him instead, and finally
the throng dissolved, the fellows seeking their
rooms. Snatches of song, bursts of laughter,
faint cheers floated from open windows for a
while, and then one by one the lights went out and
Yardley became silent.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to celebrate in advance. One
never knows what may happen.</p>

<small>DAN IS KIDNAPPED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">They were still cheering in front of Oxford
that afternoon when Dan left the gymnasium
with Mr. Payson and set off up the hill. It
was already twilight and the windows of the dormitories
were becoming quadrangles of pale yellow.
Both Mr. Payson and Dan were very silent
on the way up the path, and it was not until the
former paused in front of Merle Hall, where a
footpath began that led him across the fields toward
the village, that the silence was broken.</p>

<p>“Still think you’d rather not take that vacation
I spoke of?” Mr. Payson asked then.</p>

<p>“I’d much rather not,” Dan answered.</p>

<p>“All right. Good night.”</p>

<p>“Good night, sir. I guess I won’t be down this
evening.”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll see you to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Mr. Payson ran down the footpath and Dan
continued around by The Prospect. He felt a
little bit uncomfortable. Perhaps Payson was
right and he ought to get away from the school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
for a day. Although he insisted to the coach that
he was feeling all right, he fully realized that he
was in a rather disordered condition. He hadn’t
had a full night’s sleep for nearly a week, he had
almost forgotten what it was like to be hungry
and if someone had come up behind him and said
“Boo!” he would have jumped a foot in the air.
He dreaded Saturday more than he had ever
dreaded anything in his life, and yet he would
have given anything he possessed or hoped to possess
if he could have had Saturday come to-morrow.
The Broadwood game had taken on the
aspect of a dozen visits to the dentist all rolled
into one nightmarish lump! For the life of him
he couldn’t see how it was possible for his team to
win that game. Not one fellow played as he
should, the plays Payson had given them were
weak, and certain defeat stared them in the
face. Dan wished he had never accepted the
captaincy!</p>

<p>When he reached the head of the stairs he saw
that the door of Number 28 was wide open. A
flood of yellow light filled the end of the hall.
Probably Gerald had callers, he thought irritably,
and he didn’t want to have to talk with anyone
this evening. Luckily, however, it would soon be
supper time. But when he entered the room he
found Gerald, a thick ulster on and a cap in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
hand, quite alone. Dan’s coonskin coat lay over
the back of a chair.</p>

<p>“I thought you’d never come,” said Gerald
gayly. “Put your kitty-coat on and don’t stand
there staring. You’re going to dinner with me
to-night.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks, Gerald,” said Dan. “I—I don’t
feel up to it.”</p>

<p>“You will when you get there,” replied Gerald,
seizing the fur coat and holding it invitingly open.</p>

<p>“I’m tired,” demurred the other. But nevertheless
he worked his arms into the sleeves and
Gerald clapped a cap onto his head:</p>

<p>“Come on. The car will be here in a minute.
We’ll take a spin first and get up an appetite.”</p>

<p>Dan’s face lighted. An automobile ride sounded
good. “But I’ll have to see Collins and get
leave,” he said undecidedly.</p>

<p>“No, you won’t. That’s all fixed. There’s the
car now. Come on!” On the way downstairs
Gerald said: “By the way, I asked Tooker to
come along and bring another fellow. You don’t
mind, do you? I thought we might as well fill the
car while we were about it.”</p>

<p>Dan did mind, but didn’t say so. In front of
Clarke stood a big black touring car, its searchlights
already casting white floods of light along
the gravel drive. The chauffeur left the seat as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
the boys came down the steps and stood at attention,
touching his cap to them.</p>

<p>“Hello, Higgins!” said Dan. “How are you?”</p>

<p>“Nicely, Mr. Dan. You’re well, sir, I hope?”</p>

<p>“Fine and dandy, Higgins,” replied Dan, feeling
at the moment that this was really so. Gerald
spoke for a moment in low tones with Higgins
and then took the driver’s seat, remarking in
what seemed an unnecessarily loud tone: “We’re
going to take a ride first, Higgins. Get on the
running board and I’ll take you as far as the
station.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir.”</p>

<p>Gerald honked the horn and in a moment two
boys appeared from around the corner of Clarke.
Each carried a bag in his hand. One proved to
be Ned Tooker and the other was Kendall Burtis.</p>

<p>“I asked them to spend the night with me,”
explained Gerald carelessly to Dan. “You
fellows dressed warm enough?” he asked
them.</p>

<p>“I’ve got on everything I own,” replied Ned
as they dropped their bags on the floor of the
tonneau and climbed in. Dan took the front seat
with Gerald, Higgins slammed the door and
mounted the running board and the big car slid
noiselessly down the circling drive. At the station
it slowed down and Higgins jumped off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
touched his cap and said, “There’s about eighteen
gallons in her, Mr. Gerald.”</p>

<p>“All right, Higgins. Good night.”</p>

<p>“Good night, sir.”</p>

<p>Away shot the car again, across the bridge and
into the main street of Greenburg. “One way’s
as good as another, I guess,” said Gerald. “Any
special place you want to go to, Dan?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t care where you go.” He snuggled
down into his coat, crossed his feet and
sighed contentedly. “Just keep her going,
Gerald.”</p>

<p>The car slowed down and passed through the
town cautiously, jouncing gently over the cobbles,
past the lighted stores and around the clanging
trolley cars. Then a turn to the left and the town
was behind them and the salty breeze of the
Sound met their faces. The big lights bathed the
road ahead and Gerald’s fingers pulled at
the throttle lever. The engine began a steady
hum and the air swept past them, damp and cold.</p>

<p>“Warm enough back there?” asked Gerald over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Warm as toast,” answered Ned. “Let her
go.”</p>

<p>The road was almost straight and nearly deserted
at this time of night and the big car ate
it up at forty miles an hour. Dan forgot his troubles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
and his nerves. The moist air smoothed
away the furrows from his forehead and he half
closed his eyes and leaned back against the soft
cushions contentedly.</p>

<p>On and on they went. Now and then the Sound
became visible across the flats. Then there was
a rumble as a bridge swept underneath them and
they slowed down and hummed quietly through a
small village. A turn to the right and the air
was warmer and the smell of salt water and seaweed
gave place to the odor of autumn woods.
It was quite dark save for the light from the car.
A long hill sprang up before them and the car
took it with a fine rush, and then purred gently
down the other side. Dan thought that Gerald
was getting pretty far from home and that they
would all be late for dinner at Sound View, but
he didn’t care and he said nothing. Occasionally
Gerald spoke of the engine or the speed, but for
the most part it was a very silent quartette. The
clock on the dash pointed its hands to twenty
minutes past six as Gerald slowed down at the
junction of four roads.</p>

<p>“I wonder which way we go,” he muttered.
“Is there a sign post there, Dan?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any,” replied Dan sleepily.</p>

<p>“Neither do I. I think this road to the right
is the one we want. Tooker, put your hand in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the flap on the door next to you and see if the
blue book is there, will you?”</p>

<p>Ned found it and passed it over and Gerald held
it under the dash light and found the map he
wanted. “That’s right,” he said at last. “Just
as I thought. Here you are, Tooker.”</p>

<p>Ned took the book back and the car slid around
the corner and began its busy song again. Ten
minutes more went by and they came to another
four-corners. Gerald stopped and looked about
him in the darkness.</p>

<p>“This doesn’t seem right,” he said perplexedly.
“Where the dickens are we? Ever seen this
place, Tooker?”</p>

<p>“Never. Very beautiful, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Gerald and Kendall laughed and the former
said: “Perfectly lovely, but I’d like to know
where it is. I must have got the wrong road back
there, after all. Looks very much as though we
were lost.”</p>

<p>“Lost in the night,” murmured Ned. “How
romantic!”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess the best thing to do is to keep
on,” said Gerald. “I suppose you fellows are
starving to death, too.”</p>

<p>“I could eat if forced to,” replied Ned philosophically,
“but I feel quite happy. How about
you, Curt?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t care if I never eat,” said Kendall.
“I’d rather keep on riding.”</p>

<p>“Bully boy! This is our friend Burtis’s first
automobile experience, gentlemen, and he quite
approves of it.”</p>

<p>“Is it really?” asked Gerald. “I’m glad you
like it, Burtis. What do you say, Dan? Shall
we keep ahead or try to get back the way we
came?”</p>

<p>There was no reply and Gerald leaned over his
roommate. Then,</p>

<p>“I believe he’s asleep!” he said cautiously.</p>

<p>“All the better,” chuckled Ned. “On with the
dance!”</p>

<p>Very quietly Gerald got under way again and
very easily he ran the car for a matter of four
miles, avoiding ruts and bumps and doing his best
not to disturb Dan. At last lights showed ahead
and the car began to run over a smooth road under
arching elm trees. Ned leaned across and said
softly:</p>

<p>“On your left, Pennimore; the big white house.
Get it?”</p>

<p>“I see.” The car rolled up to the edge of the
sidewalk. “Get those bags inside, fellows, find
the proprietor and tell him we want two rooms for
the night. Here we are, Dan!” But Dan had
to be shaken gently before he condescended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
wake up, and when he did he looked about and
asked sleepily:</p>

<p>“Are we home? I must have been asleep!”</p>

<p>“No, we aren’t home,” replied Gerald, “but
we’re where we can get something to eat. We
sort of got lost and we thought we’d better stop
and get our dinner here. It’s almost seven
o’clock. There’s a telephone here and I’ll call up
the house and tell them not to wait dinner for
us.”</p>

<p>“All right.” Dan sat up and stared at the
house. “Hello!” he said, “I’ve been here before.
This is Lloyd, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” Gerald laughed. “Tooker and
Burtis have gone in to find out. Come on. I
guess the car will be all right here.”</p>

<p>“Dinner in fifteen minutes,” announced Ned as
they entered the Washington’s Head. “Come on
and get washed up. I’m as hungry as a bear.
This is lots more fun than having dinner at your
place, Pennimore,” he continued as they clattered
down the stairs. “No aspersions on Sound View,
you understand, but the unexpected is always jollier
than the expected. You had a nice little
sleep, Vinton, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Fine! And I’m hungry. Hope they have
some more of that good chicken we had here the
other day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>“They have; I ordered it. That’s why we have
to wait. This is a special repast we’re getting.
Broiled chicken, French fries and all the selicacies
of the deason. What ho for the banquet hall!”</p>

<p>Well, Ned was right. This <em>was</em> more fun than
dining in state at Sound View with a butler and
an under butler mousing around behind your chair
all the time. Even Dan agreed to that. And how
he did eat! And how they all ate! Each one of
them sent back for “that other half chicken,
Mary, and a few more of the excellentissimo
potatoes.”</p>

<p>“How do you know her name is Mary?” asked
Gerald.</p>

<p>“All waitresses are named Mary,” answered
Ned gravely. “Sometimes they try to make you
believe that their names are Gwendolyn or Hortense,
but that’s just a fake.”</p>

<p>“Bet you this one isn’t named Mary,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“Bet you she is! Wait until she comes back.”</p>

<p>And when fresh supplies had been served, and
a new plate of steaming hot biscuits had been
passed, Ned said: “These gentlemen don’t believe
that your name is Mary. It is, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the waitress with a smile.</p>

<p>“You see?” asked Ned in triumph.</p>

<p>“Bet you you asked her,” challenged Gerald.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Piffle! I don’t have to ask. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
can tell instantly. Have I asked you your name
to-night, Mary?”</p>

<p>“No, not to-night. You asked me the last time
you were here,” replied the maid with a twinkle
in her eyes. At which there was a howl of laughter,
and an automobile party eating at a distant
table stared disapprovingly across at them. That
was a very merry supper, or dinner. Dan insisted
that it was supper because they had
broiled chicken and hot biscuits. Kendall sided
with him. Ned and Gerald said it was dinner
because they had bread pudding. “No one,” declared
Ned, “ever heard of bread pudding with
hard sauce for supper. The idea is utterly preposterous.”</p>

<p>After they had eaten all they possibly could
they found a room at the back of the hotel where
an ancient pool table offered them diversion. It
was when they were on the fifth game, Gerald and
Ned playing against Dan and Kendall, that Gerald
said: “I say, fellows, wouldn’t it be fun to
spend the night here? We might as well, you
know. We’d just have to telephone back.”</p>

<p>“We’d get the very dickens,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“We might try, though. Collins couldn’t any
more than say no.” This from Ned. “I’ll stay
if the rest will.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t,” said Dan. “I ought to be on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
hand in the morning, you see. Your shot,
Tooker.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, no one needs you at school, Vinton!
Be a sport! I tell you what I’ll do. After this
game is over I’ll play you a string of fifty. If
I win we stay; if you win we go back.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be an idiot, Tooker. I tell you I ought
to be there in the morning. If you fellows want
to stay, all right. I’ll see if I can get a carriage to
take me back. I might walk, but it’s so dark
I’d probably lose my way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if you won’t stay we’ll all go back,” said
Gerald disappointedly. “I only thought it would
be a peach of a lark, Dan.”</p>

<p>“I’d like it as well as anyone,” responded Dan,
“but—”</p>

<p>“He’s afraid I’ll beat him,” interrupted Ned
sweetly, making a woefully bad shot for the corner
pocket.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll play you for fifty points, if that’s what
you want,” said Dan, “but I won’t wager staying.”</p>

<p>“Then I won’t play. You’d probably beat me
easily. That’s game. Set ’em up, Curt.”</p>

<p>“Well, if we’re going back, we’d better start,”
said Gerald. “It’s almost nine o’clock. You fellows
play a game and I’ll go out and look at the
car.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>He left the room and the others went on with
their game. And after that was over they played
another and then another, and it wasn’t until
they were starting a fourth that Gerald returned
looking very grave:</p>

<p>“Say, you fellows, come on out and help me
shove the car into the shed, will you? Something’s
wrong with her and she won’t start.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>AT THE “WASHINGTON’S HEAD”</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Won’t start!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Won’t start!” cried Dan. “She’s got
to start!”</p>

<p>Kendall looked supremely grave. Gerald
shrugged his shoulders:</p>

<p>“Well, come and help me put her in the shed
and I’ll see if I can find the trouble.”</p>

<p>Then began a half hour of investigation by Gerald.
The others held lanterns and offered suggestions.
Ned was especially helpful.</p>

<p>“The trouble,” he explained airily, “is with
your battery. It can’t bat.”</p>

<p>“I get a perfectly good spark,” replied Gerald
with apparent irritation. “As far as I can
see the trouble’s in the engine.”</p>

<p>“Let us take it to pieces,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a silly goat,” growled Dan.
“There’s no use spending the night out here, anyway.
Kick the old wagon in the shins, Gerald,
and we’ll see if we can get a carriage to take us
back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“We won’t get any carriage at this time of
night,” said Ned. “Why, it’s long after nine!
Fancy being out so late. It’s me for bed!”</p>

<p>“That’s sensible,” replied Gerald, closing the
hood. “We might just as well stay here and go
back early in the morning. We can get to school
by half-past eight. I’ll get Mr. Collins on the
telephone and tell him we’re broken down.”</p>

<p>Dan was silent a moment. Then, “All right,”
he agreed, with a shrug of his shoulders. “But
you’d better let me talk to Collins.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, or, as I say so gracefully
in French, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au contraire</i>, Gerald had better do it.
You see it’s his car and his breakdown. Let him
face the music.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Dan again. He was much
too sleepy to offer further objections. Even the
prospect of having to retire without pajamas
seemed of little moment. If only he could reach
a bed! Gerald hid himself in the telephone booth
for five minutes, and, judging from the mutterings
that leaked out, talked to someone. Then he announced
that everything was all right and they
climbed the stairs to two big, low-ceilinged rooms
on the front of the house. In one of them Dan
went through the motions of undressing—it was
the others who really performed the task for him—dabbed
his face and hands in water, knelt by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the bed to say his prayers and promptly fell
asleep there and was finally lifted between the
sheets.</p>

<p>“Night,” he murmured. Then, waking for an
instant, “Where’d I get these pajamas?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“They go with the room,” said Ned soothingly.</p>

<p>“That’s—a lie,” sighed Dan. Then he slept.</p>

<p>The others gathered on the bed in the adjoining
room and grinned.</p>

<p>“Easy!” said Ned. “We’re a very clever little
band of conspirators, we are.”</p>

<p>“Poor old Dan,” said Gerald softly. “He was
certainly sleepy! He hasn’t slept like that for
nights and nights.”</p>

<p>“What about to-morrow?” asked Kendall.
“Are you going to let him go back?”</p>

<p>Ned shrugged his shoulders. “It’s up to him, I
guess. We can’t tie him. Maybe he will be reasonable.
Think you can get your car started in
time to take us back, Pennimore?”</p>

<p>Gerald smiled. “I think she will go all right
when I put the connections back.”</p>

<p>“It was a lucky thing that Vinton didn’t know
much about autos,” laughed Ned.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t have mattered if he had. He was
too sleepy to see anything. Well, let’s get to
bed. I’m dog tired.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re no tog direder than I am,” responded
Ned.</p>

<p>Dan slept without moving for nine hours.
Then he awoke in a strange room that was flooded
with sunlight. He stared at the white walls and
the cracked ceiling and wondered where he was.
Beside him Gerald was soundly slumbering.
While he was still trying to make it out the floor
creaked and Ned appeared. Then Dan remembered.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he said, still somewhat dazed with
sleep. “What time is it?”</p>

<p>“Seven-thirty, sir. Will you have your tub
now, sir?”</p>

<p>Dan was looking perplexedly at the pajamas he
wore.</p>

<p>“Where’d I get these things? They look a
whole lot like my own.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Don’t you usually wear your own
pajamas?” asked Ned gravely. Gerald stirred
and opened his eyes, sighed and closed them again.</p>

<p>“But how did they get here?” Dan persisted.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s it? Well, you see, you never can
tell when you start out in your friend’s car where
you’ll end up. So we thought we’d better be on
the safe side. You’ll find your toothbrush, hairbrush,
comb, a change of linen and some other
trifles on the bureau.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Dan stared a moment, frowningly. Then,</p>

<p>“I see,” he grunted. “It was a put-up job.”</p>

<p>“A gentle and kindly conspiracy,” replied Ned.
“Payson said you must get away and sleep. He
came to me. Pennimore here was with him. We
fixed up the scheme, he got leave of absence for
you to visit Pennimore until Saturday, the rest
of us got excused overnight and the rest you
know.”</p>

<p>“Hm; and—and that crazy car wasn’t busted
after all?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit. Pennimore—the deceitful youth!—pulled
the wires off the plugs. Now you know
all. We throw ourselves on your mercy!”</p>

<p>“You’re a precious lot of—of—”</p>

<p>“Don’t spare us,” said Ned humbly.</p>

<p>“Of kidnappers,” ended Dan. But he didn’t
sound very angry, and Gerald, who had been simulating
slumber until the worst was over, awoke
suddenly with a prodigious yawn.</p>

<p>“Hello, you chaps!” he said. “Good morning.”</p>

<p>“Good morning!” grunted Dan. “I’ve a good
mind to choke you, you deceitful pup!” To
prove his inclination he reached for Gerald, but
that youth was too quick for him and was in the
middle of the floor in an instant. Then Kendall
came in and they settled themselves on the bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
and talked it all over. Dan felt too rested to
be angry, and when Ned broached the programme
for the day he was surprisingly complaisant. The
rest of them, Ned explained, had to go back in
time for recitations. But Payson wanted Dan to
stay in Lloyd and take things easy. The others
would be back again by five o’clock. They would
all spend the night here and return to Yardley
in the morning in plenty of time for luncheon.
What did Dan say?</p>

<p>Dan said: “All right. Tell Payson I slept like
a top and am feeling fine. I’ll call him up after
a while and talk with him myself, though. I
guess there isn’t really anything for me to do
at school. Now how about breakfast?”</p>

<p>They all ate hungrily, Gerald brought the car
around at half-past eight and he and Ned and
Kendall set off for school. As the car sped out
of sight they turned and waved at Dan on the
porch. And Dan waved back gayly, and then,
thrusting his hands into his pockets and whistling
a tune, set off along the quiet street with a delicious
feeling of playing “hookey.” He had the
whole day ahead of him and nothing to do but
eat and loaf! No lessons, no practice, no problems
to settle with Payson or Cowles, no nothing!
It was simply fine!</p>

<p>Presently he came to a little bridge with stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
parapets that seemed just fashioned for idlers
like he. He seated himself on one of them, his
feet dangling above the little stream that went
gurgling by to turn and twist its way through a
meadow. Once he saw a fish and he wished he
had a hook and line. Then he gathered chips of
mortar from the wall, dropped them into the water
and watched them go sidling down to the
bottom. The sun was warm, although a light
breeze rustled the dead leaves in the roadway.
The sky was blue overhead, and Dan thought
thankfully, “A fine day to-morrow for the game.”
Then with a start he realized that he had quite
forgotten all about the game for hours! Hadn’t
once thought of it since getting out of bed! And
even now it didn’t trouble him. They might win
it. If they didn’t—why, there you were! After
all, it was no matter of life or death. Games had
been lost before. To be sure, he was captain and
he meant to do all he could to win, but if he
failed, why, he still would have done the best he
knew how; and that, he told himself philosophically,
was all anyone could do. And then a pair
of crows came sailing overhead, cawing loudly,
and he forgot again about the game.</p>

<p>Almost before he knew it, it was noon. A bell
somewhere in the little village struck twelve. He
pulled himself lazily off the wall and ambled back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
to the inn. There was time before dinner to call
up Mr. Payson, and he did it.</p>

<p>“I’m having a bully time,” he told the coach.
“Been sitting on the bridge all the morning throwing
pebbles into the water.”</p>

<p>“Good stuff,” replied the voice at the other
end. “Go back this afternoon and throw the rest
in.”</p>

<p>“No, I think I’ll go to sleep!” laughed Dan.
“Everything all right? If you want me, say so
and I’ll come over.”</p>

<p>“Don’t want you at all. Don’t want to see you
until eleven to-morrow forenoon. Everything is
all right here. And I think we’re going to have
a fine day to-morrow. How’s your appetite?”</p>

<p>“It’s awful! I can’t get enough.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t overdo it. Better eat light this
evening, Vinton. Eat what you want, though.
Feeling pretty well, are you?”</p>

<p>“Like a fighting cock, sir!”</p>

<p>“That’s fine. Keep it up. Go to bed early to-night
and get some more sleep. Good-by.”</p>

<p>Dan had the dining-room pretty much to himself
that noon and was rather glad of it, since he was
a little bit ashamed of the way he ate. He felt
like apologizing to Mary, the waitress, and to the
proprietor. After dinner he lounged upstairs to
the room, feeling delightfully sleepy, found a magazine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
that Gerald had thoughtfully added to the
contents of one of the bags and tried to read. But
ten minutes later he was stretched out on top of
the bed fast asleep.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>KENDALL EXPLAINS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Dan slept for two hours and might have slept
longer had it not been that a little cool
breeze began to find its way through the
wide-open windows. It was after half-past three
then, and he went downstairs and wrote a letter
home. And finally, at a little before five, there
was a terrific honking in the distance, followed
presently by the appearance of a cloud of dust
down the road and eventually by the arrival of the
Pennimore car and the three conspirators.</p>

<p>“Get in,” Gerald commanded. “We’re going
for a ride before supper.”</p>

<p>So Dan went up and got into his coat and soon
they were off along the twilight road. That was
a ride to remember. They were gone one hour
and covered forty-three miles by the speedometer.
And if there were four hungrier lads in the length
and breadth of the land than those four when
they sat down to supper, I envy them! After supper
they went upstairs to what a white-enameled
plate on the door informed them was the Ladies’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
Parlor and Ned strummed tunes on the old yellow-keyed
piano and they all sang and made as much
noise as they pleased. Still later they donned
sweaters or coats and went down to the porch
and put chairs along the railing and sat there
with their feet as high as their heads and talked.
The breeze had subsided and the night was still
and quite warm for the sixteenth of November.
A big lob-sided moon climbed up over the tops
of the naked elms and flooded the porch with light.
They talked of many, many things; almost everything,
in fact, except football. To have listened
to them one might have thought that there was
never such a thing as football. Finally Gerald
said:</p>

<p>“It was a night a good deal like this, Dan, that
we paid our call on Broadwood last spring.”</p>

<p>And then, Ned urging, Dan, with Gerald interpolating
at intervals, told the story of the famous
joke on Broadwood perpetrated by the S. P. M.
(“Society of Predatory Marauders,” explained
Gerald.) And Kendall, who had never heard of
the affair before, listened with open ears. And
when Dan had finished Kendall burst out with:</p>

<p>“Then that’s why they tried to paint the flagpole!”</p>

<p>“Who? What do you mean?” exclaimed the
others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! Nothing! That is—!”</p>

<p>“Who tried to paint the flagpole?” Dan demanded.
“What do you know about that,
Burtis?”</p>

<p>“I—I thought maybe they did,” stammered
Kendall.</p>

<p>“Broadwood? I never thought of that.” This
from Dan.</p>

<p>“Nobody ever found out who did do that
stunt,” said Ned thoughtfully. There was a moment’s
silence. Then Ned asked suddenly:</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it about that time you went on pro,
Curt?”</p>

<p>“It—it was a day or so afterwards,” replied
Kendall.</p>

<p>“Hm. Nice weather we’re having.”</p>

<p>“What’s the point, Tooker?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“Ask our friend, Mr. Bendall Kurtis.”</p>

<p>“All right, Burtis, you’ve got the floor. If
there’s a story, let’s have it.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t; at least, there’s nothing I can
tell,” replied Kendall.</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought you knew something.”</p>

<p>“What did you mean, Tooker?” asked Gerald.
“Out with it.”</p>

<p>Ned’s chair came down with a crash on the
porch and he pointed an accusing finger at Kendall.
“There,” he declared dramatically, “is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
one man who can explain the Mystery of the Paint
on the Flagpole!”</p>

<p>“Burtis? Nonsense!” Dan laughed. “Kick
him, Burtis.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Ned, folding his arms with dignity,
“then ask him to explain why he was put
on probation the next day.”</p>

<p>“Consider yourself asked, Burtis,” Gerald
laughed.</p>

<p>“Answer!” commanded Ned. “We are all
friends together and our motto is ‘Discretion.’”</p>

<p>“Why—why—” Kendall stammered. “It
isn’t my secret. You see— Well, I do know
about it, but I oughtn’t to tell. I refused to tell
Mr. Collins, and that’s why he put me on
probation. I didn’t want them to get into
trouble.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t want who to get into trouble?” asked
Ned with the manner of a Grand Inquisitor.</p>

<p>“Those fellows.”</p>

<p>“What fellows?”</p>

<p>“The fellows who—who did it.”</p>

<p>“You mean the Broadwood fellows?” asked
Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“Yes—no—”</p>

<p>“Then Broadwood <em>did</em> do it!” exclaimed Ned
triumphantly. “I knew it! Now tell us all about
it. We all swear secrecy, Curt. By yon gleaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
orb we pledge ourselves to never divulge what
we are about to hear! Proceed!”</p>

<p>And finally Kendall proceeded and told the
whole story from the time he had overheard the
conversation between the Broadwood boys in
the drug store until he had gone out of the Office
in disgrace. And he talked to three deeply interested
hearers.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” exclaimed Dan when
Kendall had finished.</p>

<p>“I’ll be double jiggered,” Ned declared. “Do
you mean to tell me, Curt, that you were chump
enough to let Collins put you on pro just to save
those idiots?”</p>

<p>“I was afraid he would make trouble for them,”
said Kendall.</p>

<p>“What of it? Don’t you know that Broadwood
is our hereditary foe?”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Tooker,” said Dan. “He was quite
right. Only I guess his—what-do-you-call-it?—martyrdom
was unnecessary. I don’t believe
Collins would have taken it up with Broadwood’s
faculty. Old Toby might have, but not Collins.”</p>

<p>“And that’s why you gave up football!” marveled
Gerald.</p>

<p>“Yes; he said I couldn’t play any longer,” replied
Kendall regretfully.</p>

<p>Ned arose and brushed an imaginary tear from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
his eye. “Curt,” he said in a voice that trembled
with emotion, “you’re a hero!” He shook Kendall’s
hand. “You’re a—a martyr to a principal!
Get that, fellows? Principal with an ‘al.’
Good, what?”</p>

<p>“Punk,” laughed Dan. “Well, Burtis, I’m
glad I got you back on the Second Team. I didn’t
know why the dickens I was doing it at the time,
but I see now that my instincts prompted.”</p>

<p>“I think Collins ought to know the truth of it,”
exclaimed Gerald. “Someone ought to tell him.
I will if no one else does.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t do that,” said Dan. “No use
opening old sores. Collins did what he thought
was fair; the evidence was all against Burtis.
It’s over with now and nobody’s any the worse
for it.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Ned agreed. “Let deeping
slogs lie. I do wish I’d known you then, Curt;
I surely would have liked to have been there when
you flashed the torch on them! We needn’t say
anything to Collins about it, fellows, but it’s too
good a joke on Broadwood to keep to ourselves,
that is, if Curt doesn’t mind having it known.”</p>

<p>Kendall said he didn’t care about that, and he
was quite sure he didn’t want to bother Mr. Collins
with the affair. “He—he was awfully nice
about it. And he’s been very kind ever since.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>“Collins,” said Ned with conviction, “is one
fine man.”</p>

<p>And the others gravely agreed.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock they went yawning up to their
rooms, and at ten nothing was to be heard therein
but evidences of healthy slumber.</p>

<p>Mr. Payson had forbidden Dan to return before
eleven, but Gerald was forced to be on hand fairly
early, since the cross-country race with Broadwood—Nordham
had declined Goodyear’s invitation
to enter the contest—was due to start at ten-thirty,
and so it was agreed that they should all
return at half-past nine. They were up early and
had breakfast at a quarter to eight. The morning
had fulfilled the promise of the preceding
day. It was an Indian Summer day if ever there
was one. Dan had slept like a log, he asserted,
and never felt better in his life.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet, though,” he said ruefully, “that I’ve
taken on six or seven pounds. I can feel it just
as plain!”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” said Gerald. “You can stand
it. Besides,” he added with a grin, “it will be
all gone by four this afternoon.”</p>

<p>There seemed no good reason for continuing
the taboo on the subject of the game, and during
the rest of breakfast they discussed it without
ceasing. Afterwards Gerald scouted out for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
morning paper and finally found one and Dan read
the football news it contained aloud to the others
as they sat on the steps and waited for the time
to start.</p>

<p>“‘Broadwood,’” read Dan, “‘is a slight favorite
in to-day’s battle with Yardley Hall at
Wissining. Her victories have been woefully few
of late and there is a prevalent feeling that her
turn has come. Although handicapped at the beginning
of the season by injuries to three of her
best men, Broadwood hit her stride in the game
with Stamford College two weeks ago and has
been coming ever since. She has in Reid, Raynor
and Rhodes—the Three R’s, as Broadwood
calls them—an exceptionally good back-field trio.
They have plenty of weight, are exceptionally
quick and have so far proved extremely hard to
stop. The only occurring criticism of the Broadwood
back-field that will start the Yardley Hall
game is that, composed, as it is, of players whose
strong point is plunging, it can afford but little
variety of offense. Broadwood has not developed
the running game this year to any great
extent, and, with the exception of Saunders, who
is as yet an almost unknown quantity at quarter,
and who may possess possibilities in this line that
he has not yet shown, what end-running talent
she has lies with her second-string backs.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>“That,” observed Dan, interrupting himself,
“is rot. Raynor never made a yard at straight
line-bucking in his life. He’s a typical dodging
back, and he cut off about seventy yards in the
Nordham game on runs outside tackle. That’s
just a sample of the sort of stuff they send out
in the hope of misleading the opponent. Just as
though we hadn’t watched their team all the fall!”</p>

<p>“What other untruths does the Broadwood correspondent
indulge in?” asked Ned, who was boring
an extra hole in his leather belt with the file-blade
of his knife. “Go on, Vinton.”</p>

<p>“‘In the line,’” Dan continued, “‘Broadwood
is more than averagely strong. O’Brien, at center,
although light, is undoubtedly one of the cleverest
players in his position on any preparatory
school team.’ (“That’s a fact,” interpolated
Dan.) ‘O’Brien was a substitute last year, but
played part of the Yardley Hall game. The
guards are new men this year, but have proved
excellent on the defense. The same may be said
of the tackles, one of whom, Weldon, played his
position last season. At the ends Broadwood has
Captain Bishop and Furniss, with Thurston and
Donnelly as substitutes. Captain Bishop is an
ideal end player, while Furniss has shown so far
more promise than fulfillment. By an odd coincidence
Captain Bishop will play opposite Yardley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Hall’s captain, Vinton, and a battle royal is
looked for between the rival leaders.</p>

<p>“‘There is a feeling here at Broadwood that
if any fault can be found with the development
of this year’s team it must be on the score that
in perfecting what appears to be a remarkably
strong defense the coaches have failed to produce
an offense of more than ordinary value. Granting
then what seems to be the case, that Broadwood’s
defense is fully equal if not superior to
Yardley Hall’s, the outcome of the struggle will
depend on which team can show the strongest attack.
A tie score is by no means beyond the realm
of possibility, but here at Broadwood coaches and
players alike agree that if the Green doesn’t come
out of the fray victor by the margin of at least
one touchdown they will be greatly surprised.’”</p>

<p>“Business of looking surprised by Broadwood
coaches,” murmured Ned, snapping his knife shut
and worming his belt back into place. “That’s
all right for their side of the thing, Vinton. Now,
prithee, sweet youth, what says Yardley?”</p>

<p>“Yardley doesn’t say anything,” replied Dan,
searching the page with a frown. “Who’s our
correspondent? Anyone know?”</p>

<p>“Chambers used to be,” said Gerald. “I don’t
know who is now.”</p>

<p>“Hold on! Here’s something,” announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Dan. “‘Wissining, Conn., November 16. Yardley
Hall School and Broadwood Academy will
meet to-morrow on the Yardley gridiron for their
annual championship battle. Yardley is expected
to repeat her victories of the last two years, although
a piece of eleventh-hour ill-luck may spoil
her chances. Yardley’s captain and left end, Dan
Vinton, may not be able to enter the game. Captain
Vinton has been ill for about a week and on
Thursday, obeying doctor’s orders, left school and
has not been heard of since. Whether he will return
in time for the game to-morrow, or whether,
if he does return, he will be able to take part in
it, is not known. Vinton’s leadership and his
work at the left end of the Yardley line will be
greatly missed.’”</p>

<p>“What do you think of that?” ejaculated
Gerald.</p>

<p>Dan laughed. “I guess I’d better go back and
show myself,” he said. “I wonder who started
that story.”</p>

<p>“The fellow who wrote it for the paper,” replied
Ned. “Plenty of fellows knew that you had
just gone off to rest up until this morning, although
I guess none of them knew where you’d
gone. What time is it? Let’s get a move on!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>THE MORNING OF THE GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">They spun back to Wissining in something
close to ten minutes, stopping, with a triumphant
toot of the horn, in front of Clarke
at twenty minutes to ten. Half a dozen fellows
who had seen the arrival of the automobile
rushed up to shake Dan’s hand and inquire
anxiously if he were going to play.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Dan, “and we’re going to win.”</p>

<p>Then he made his escape to his room, while Gerald
and the others sped around to the gymnasium
in the car. At a few minutes after the hour Gerald
took the wheel again and, with ten boys packed
into or onto it, swung the automobile’s nose toward
Broadwood. They didn’t go that far, however,
as the start of the cross-country race was
at the Old Cider Mill, a mile beyond the bridge.
Here the road was already lined with spectators,
while numerous bare-legged youths, wrapped in
many-hued bath-gowns, awaited the signal. Gerald
steered the car into the bushes at one side
of the road and left it in charge of Ned. He and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Kendall made themselves comfortable in the rear
seat, where they were presently joined by Arthur
Thompson. Arthur had discarded his crutch
several days before, but was glad of a place
where he might watch events and favor his
knee.</p>

<p>“Gerald says that Dan’s back,” said Arthur
as he climbed into the front seat. “Have you
seen him, Tooker?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve seen him. In fact, Thompson, we
spent last night and the night before with him
at Lloyd. He was at the hotel over there. He
was sort of done up when Payson sent him off,
but he’s as fit as a fiddle now. How’s your knee,
by the way?”</p>

<p>“All right, thanks. It gets sort of tired,
though, if I use it much. So Dan’s really going
to play? The paper said—”</p>

<p>“Yes, we saw that. He’s going to play all
right, Thompson. By the way, do you know
Burtis?”</p>

<p>“We used to see each other on the field a while
back,” responded Arthur, shaking hands. “There,
they’re going to start. I hope Gerald gets first
place to-day. If he does they can’t very well help
making him captain for next year; they probably
will anyway. They’re off!”</p>

<p>The sharp report of the pistol rent the air, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
lines of runners sprang away and the crowd closed
in behind them.</p>

<p>“What I object to,” said Ned, when the spectators
had begun to stream off up the road toward
the finish, a mile distant, “is that I’ve got to leave
this comfortable seat and hit the dusty highway
if I want to see the finish.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t mind it a bit,” Kendall laughed,
“if you had a golf ball in front of you.”</p>

<p>“I expected to stay here,” said Arthur. “You
can get a pretty good idea of things at this point,
you know, but if I thought Gerald wouldn’t mind
my running the car I’d go on up to the finish.”</p>

<p>“Can you run it?” asked Ned eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I can run it all right, but he might not
like it.”</p>

<p>“Not like it! He’d be tickled to death, Thompson.
He said coming down that he wished I could
take the car to the finish and get him there. He
was going to telephone home and have the chauffeur
come and do it, but he didn’t have time. If
you can run her, Thompson, do your worst.”</p>

<p>“All right. Can you crank her for me? My
knee’s still sort of wobbly.”</p>

<p>“I’m the original cranker,” responded Ned,
leaping out. “All right? Let her go!”</p>

<p><em>Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug</em>, said the big car.
And a minute later it was running softly along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the road, Arthur at the wheel. It required some
manipulation to get the car berthed near the finish
line, for Broadwood and Yardley were there
in force and resented yielding a foot of ground.
Ned finally solved the problem by taking down
the bars of a fence and Arthur “parked” the car
in somebody’s meadow.</p>

<p>There was still some time to wait, for the four-mile
course was a fairly difficult one, one part of
it, about three-quarters of a mile long, being over
the fields. While they waited Arthur, in response
to a question from Kendall, explained the conditions
of the contest. There were, he said, ten
runners on each team, of which the first eight to
finish counted in the result. The first man over
the line counted one point for his team, the second
man two points, the third man three points, and
so on, the team scoring the lowest total winning
the race.</p>

<p>“There isn’t much doubt but that we’ll win,”
he said. “The main interest in the race lies in
the struggle for first honors. Crossett of Broadwood,
Gerald and Sherwood of our team, are out
for those. I think Gerald ought to beat Crossett,
but whether he can get away from Sherwood is
another matter. Goodyear may show up better
than he’s been doing, too. He got first place last
year. Hiltz may get into the front, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>“That roommate of yours is running, isn’t
he?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Harry? Yes, he’s in it, but I guess he isn’t
very fast yet. I ran myself last year, but I didn’t
finish; had a cramp. This year I went in for
football instead. Guess I’d better have stayed
with the Cross-Country Team; a cramp is better
than a sprained knee.”</p>

<p>“If Pennimore doesn’t get the captaincy, who
will?” asked Kendall.</p>

<p>“Holder, probably. He and Gerald are about
the only Second Class fellows who have had any
experience. Someone’s coming now, I guess.
Climb up, Tooker, and take a squint.”</p>

<p>“Two of them,” announced Ned, “about a quarter
of a mile up the road.”</p>

<p>Kendall sprang onto the seat beside him, and
eventually Arthur too, forgetting his knee, got
to his feet. Far up the road two figures in white
shirts and trunks were trotting doggedly toward
the finish. They appeared to be quite close together,
but who they were was still uncertain. Finally
the sunlight gleamed on a blue ribbon across
the breast of the leader and the Yardley contingent
sent up a shout of delight. Nearer and
nearer they came, while three other runners appeared
in sight in the distance. Finally,</p>

<p>“That’s Gerald!” exclaimed Arthur with relief.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
“And that’s Goodyear just behind him.
First two for us! <em>Whoopee!</em>”</p>

<p>It was a gallant race to the line, but the younger
boy had enough left in him to spurt just before
the finish and win from his captain by a good ten
or twelve yards. The two runners were surrounded
by their shouting friends, and in a minute
Gerald, weary but happy, was climbing into the
car.</p>

<p>Crossett, of Broadwood, won third place from
Hiltz and Sherwood, of Yardley, and then no more
runners finished for several minutes. Finally
two tired Broadwood youths trailed in, and
Holder and Merrow fought for eighth place.
Holder won, but young Merrow had run a plucky
race and received such a hearty salvo of applause
that he got embarrassed and quickly dodged into
the crowd. A few minutes later Yardley’s eighth
man had finished and the score was known. It
was a decisive victory for the Blue, 51 to 85, and
Yardley set off for home, passing the last stragglers
on the way, two Yardley and six Broadwood
fellows. Gerald and Arthur sat on the front seat
of the car going back, with Ned, Kendall, Harry
Merrow and Goodyear behind. On the way up
the hill Arthur leaned over and whispered in Gerald’s
ear:</p>

<p>“How does it sound, Gerald?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>“What?” asked the other.</p>

<p>“Why, ‘Captain Pennimore’!”</p>

<p>“Shut up,” growled Gerald sheepishly. “Besides,
maybe I won’t get it,” he added.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry; you will!”</p>

<p>And a week afterwards he did.</p>

<p>As the car rolled past Oxford on the way
around to the gymnasium Ned asked:</p>

<p>“What are you rubbering at, Curt?”</p>

<p>“I was looking at that man on the steps,” responded
Kendall. “Did you notice him, Ned?
Do you know who he is?”</p>

<p>“That was Payson, you chump!”</p>

<p>“No, I mean the man with him. He looked like
someone I—used—to know.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice him,” replied Ned. “Some
Old Grad back for the game, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“All out!” shouted Gerald. “Far as the car
goes!”</p>

<p><em>Honk! Honk! Honk!</em> said the horn.</p>

<p class="cap">Such a day as it was for the game! Quite
perfect from the spectator’s point of view;
a little bit too warm, perhaps, judged by the
player’s standard; a day of days however you
looked at it. The sky was blue overhead and
faded to gray toward the horizon where an autumn
haze brooded above the earth. The sun was
gently warm, and the turf, which had retained
much of its summer green in spite of frosts, was
dry and springy underfoot. From the flagstaff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
over the grand stand the big blue flag with the
vivid white Y hung lazily, for never a sign of a
breeze stirred it. The stands were filled by the
time the two teams trotted out to warm up for
the fray, and the Greenburg Band, a cheerful
blotch of scarlet in the midst of the somber-hued
bank of spectators, was brazenly crashing out a
two-step. Inside the ropes was a line of settees
on which sat the substitutes, the members of the
Second Team—little badges of blue ribbon adorning
their coats—and other privileged persons.
Andy Ryan, the little red-haired trainer, was
there, and Paddy, the rubber, with a fine assortment
of head guards and extra shoes and extra
laces and electric tape and two big carboys of
spring water and other necessary articles. In a
big pile lay the blankets, with an extra football
or two reposing beside them. Cowles, looking
nervous and excited—it had been a hard and busy
week for the manager—strode by with his big pad
of paper in hand. Mr. Payson, talking to the
stranger who had aroused Kendall’s curiosity,
came on and seated himself at the end of the row
of benches. Then around the corner of the stand
trotted the Broadwood team. Under or over the
ropes they went, bunched themselves into two
squads and set diligently to work. They looked
a pretty good lot of fellows; big, happy, trained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
to the moment. From across the field came a
mighty Broadwood cheer.</p>

<p>An instant later it was Yardley’s turn to applaud,
for some thirty blue-stockinged youths
dribbled onto the turf, Dan leading, peeled off
their sweaters and set to work. Only one boy
was left out of the preliminary practice, and he
pulled a blanket from the pile and seated himself
on the bench. It was Arthur Thompson. Five
minutes or so of signal work and punting, and then
the officials sauntered on, one, a chubby little man
in a faded purple-and-white sweater and a pair
of stained flannel trousers, called the captains to
him, a coin went spinning up into the sunlight,
three heads bent over it and all save the players
who were to begin the game left the field. Payson
and Dan conferred a moment and then the opposing
armies fell into position. Broadwood had
won the toss and Yardley had the ball.</p>

<p>“Ready, Broadwood? Ready, Yardley?”</p>

<p>The whistle piped merrily. Ridge stepped forward
with two long strides, the ball sped away
down the field, turning over and over in its flight,
and the Yardley players leaped forward. The
game was on.</p>

<p>Broadwood caught on her thirty-yard line and,
with good protection for the runner, swept back
to the forty. Her first play sought information.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
“How’s your center?” asked Broadwood, hurling
her full-back at Merriwell. “Quite well,
thank you,” replied Yardley, crumpling Rhodes
up for a half-yard gain. Broadwood seemed to
doubt it, however, for she tried Reid at the other
side of center and gained two yards. Then she
chose to kick and Rhodes sent the ball to the
Blue’s forty-four yard line on a poor punt.
Stearns, however, was unable to gain after the
catch and it was Yardley’s ball on her forty-five
yards.</p>

<p>Simms opened up brilliantly with the Yardley
tackle shift and Roeder went clean through the
Broadwood line for eight yards. Stearns slid by
left tackle for three more and it was first down.
Simms’s try around the left end on the next play
was killed and Ridge was called back to punt. The
attempt was short and went out near the enemy’s
forty-five yards. Broadwood worked a double
pass for four and a straight plunge on center for
three. Then Rhodes punted again and Yardley
was penalized for off-side. For the succeeding
five minutes of the period the ball hovered between
the forty-yard lines. The two teams appeared
very evenly matched and seemed to entertain
deep respect for each other. Finally, with
the ball on her forty-seven yards, Yardley sent
Stearns around right end on a fake kick play and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
that worthy young gentleman reeled off twelve
yards before he was brought down. Encouraged
by this and the wild cheers from the Yardley
stand, the Blue set out to reach the goal.</p>

<p>Roeder cut loose for six yards and Hammel
made it first down. A penalty for holding on the
part of Broadwood still further cut down the distance.
On Broadwood’s thirty Simms brought
his tackles together again on the shift and Roeder
gained four through the Green’s left wing.
Stearns ran wide and dodged past the enemy for
three. Hammel crashed out enough to make first
down. But now, near her goal, Broadwood tightened.
Roeder failed to gain, Hammel made three
and Simms tried a forward pass to Dan. But
Broadwood was watching and the pass was intercepted.</p>

<p>Broadwood kicked on first down and the ball
went to Simms, who ran back over three white
lines to Broadwood’s thirty-five. Once more
Roeder was brought into play. Five yards resulted,
but on the next play he was hurled back
for a loss. Simms tried an on-side kick which
Norton recovered, but Broadwood stopped him
on her eighteen-yard line. There Broadwood
stood like a stone wall. Two attempts at the line
netted four yards. Dan and Simms put their
heads together, and then Norton fell back as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
though to try at goal with a drop-kick. But when
the ball came back it went to Stearns, and he swept
wide into the field, looking for an opening.
Broadwood, however, was not fooled and after
speeding almost the width of the field Stearns was
tackled for no gain and Yardley had lost the ball.
A groan went up from the Yardley stand as
Simms turned and trotted back down the field.
Broadwood kicked out of danger, Stearns caught
near the middle of the field and the whistle blew.</p>

<p>The second period was almost a repetition of
the first. Again Yardley, after marching from
her forty yards, threatened Broadwood’s goal,
only to lose the ball on the twenty-one yard line,
this time by a fumble. Broadwood kicked at
once. It seemed as though her policy was to play
a purely defensive game through the first two
periods, possibly in the hope of wearing down her
opponent, and then strike hard. Fumbles and
penalties came fast in that period, but Broadwood
was at fault quite as often as Yardley. But the
fumbles were not costly, although once Raynor,
Broadwood’s left half, started with a clear field
ahead of him and the ball tucked under his arm.
But both Dan and Mitchell gave chase and pulled
him down from behind before he had covered ten
yards. It was in the second that Broadwood tried
her one forlorn attempt at a field goal. On Yardley’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
thirty yards, with two downs against her,
Broadwood decided to score from placement.
Captain Bishop dropped back, and, with the quarter
holding the ball, kicked, while the stands held
their breath. Bishop’s direction was good but the
ball fell far short of the goal and the danger was
over. After that it was a see-saw between the
two thirty yards, Yardley fighting savagely to
score, Broadwood doggedly holding her back and
punting whenever the ball was within her territory.
Now and then one side or the other tried
an end run, but never successfully in that period.
Dan and the opposing captain fought a great battle
at the ends of their respective lines, with honors
about even. The period and the half ended
with the ball in Broadwood’s possession on Yardley’s
forty-six yards.</p>

<p>Yardley was a little disappointed and many expressions
of the disappointment were heard on
the seats as the two teams bundled themselves in
their blankets and trotted off to the gymnasium.
Yardley, it seemed, had done all the work and to
no purpose, while Broadwood had played on the
defensive and saved her strength. But Yardley
answered defiantly to every Broadwood cheer that
was hurled across the field, the band played heroically,
the songs were sung and the minutes
dragged along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>Huddled in amongst the Second Team members,
Kendall had watched the contest with rapt enjoyment.
Of course, being only human, he saw where
Simms and Dan Vinton were making awful mistakes,
and he wondered how Mr. Payson could
idle along the side-line and look so calm and imperturbable.
As he didn’t know his neighbors on
either side of him well enough to discuss the game
with them, he was forced to keep his opinions and
emotions bottled up inside. When the teams trotted
off after the second period Mr. Payson went
too, and the man whom Kendall had seen with him
left the bench to stretch his legs and came walking
up the line. He was about twenty-five, a big,
good-looking, smiling man in a brown Norfolk
suit, with a small bunch of bachelor’s buttons on
the lapel of his jacket. Kendall watched him approach
with a sort of fascination. He was quite,
quite certain that he had met the man and known
him. Why, he even knew the tones of the man’s
voice! But who he was he couldn’t for the very
life of him remember! As he came near the
man’s eyes wandered along the benches, fell on
Kendall, paused a moment and went on. But in
the next instant they were back again, questioning,
puzzling. Then Kendall did what was for
him a very courageous thing. He bowed! As he
did he felt the blood rushing into his cheeks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
wished he hadn’t. Suppose, after all, the man
was a total stranger! But Kendall needn’t have
feared. The man’s face broke into a smile of recognition
and he strode straight over to the bench,
tucking a cane under his arm and stretching out
a gloved hand.</p>

<p>“Well, if it isn’t Kendall!” exclaimed a deep,
pleasant voice. “I didn’t know you were here, my
boy,” he continued as they shook hands. “This
your first year?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” Kendall was still in the dark and
the man noticed it and laughed.</p>

<p>“You don’t remember me after all, do you?”
he laughed.</p>

<p>“I—I know that I know you,” stammered Kendall,
“but—but—”</p>

<p>“Ever kick a football?” asked the other slyly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dana!” cried Kendall. “Gee, I knew I
knew you!”</p>

<p class="cap">“You’ve got it right,” said Mr. Dana.
“Here, let’s sit down; I want to talk to
you.” He looked toward the bench and
one of the Second Team fellows got up politely
and moved to another seat. “Now tell me all
about it. This is your first year, eh? Well, do
you like it? Was I wrong when I used to tell
you to come to Yardley?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I like it very much indeed.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. Getting on all right, are you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“But, look here, Kendall— By the way, I
can’t recall your last name, my boy. Was it
Benson?”</p>

<p>“Burtis, sir.”</p>

<p>“Burtis, of course!” Mr. Dana slapped his
knee. “And how are your folks, Burtis? Father
and mother well, I hope? They’re nice people.
We had a bully summer up there that time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, thank you, they’re all well.”</p>

<p>“And the old spotted cow that chased me out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
of the barnyard one morning? How’s she getting
on?”</p>

<p>“She’s gone,” laughed Kendall. “We made
beef of her.”</p>

<p>“How are the mighty fallen!” said Mr. Dana.
“Burtis, that cow was one of the few persons—or
things—I was ever afraid of!” He noticed
the blue badge on Kendall’s coat and nodded at
it. “What sort of a decoration is that? What
noble deed have you performed to be allowed to
wear that proud insignia?”</p>

<p>“It’s just a badge to get inside the ropes, sir.
I was playing football on the Second Team for a
while.”</p>

<p>“Second? Dear me, I thought you’d make the
first and kick yourself to glory and fame, Burtis!
Haven’t forgotten all we taught you about punting
and drop-kicking, have you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I—I’ve still got that ball.”</p>

<p>“What ball is that?”</p>

<p>“The one you gave me when you left our place,
sir.”</p>

<p>“I’d forgotten about it, Burtis. You still have
it, you say. It must be getting a pension now,
eh? But, look here, why didn’t you get taken
on to the First Team, Burtis? If there was ever a
team in need of a good punter, to say nothing of a
drop-kicker, it’s this one right here. Why, Payson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
told me not an hour ago that kicking was their
weakest department.”</p>

<p>“I—I did try, Mr. Dana, but I had—bad luck.”
And then Kendall told about his probation and
how he had to give up football and how Dan Vinton
had got him back onto the Second Team at the
end of the season.</p>

<p>“Too bad.” Mr. Dana shook his head. “That
sort of thing doesn’t pay, Burtis. Of course, I
don’t object to a fellow having his fun, but it’s a
mistake to get the Office down on you. See what
it’s cost in your case. If you hadn’t got on probation
you might have made the First and been
out there now winning the game for us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I know; but it wasn’t really my fault.
It—it was a sort of mistake.”</p>

<p>“Was it?” Mr. Dana smiled. “Well, don’t
have too many of them. Mistakes are costly.
Still kick pretty well, do you? We used to have
great hopes of you at the farm, Burtis. Your
legs seemed made for kicking a football and you
seemed to get the hang of it remarkably well.
Did you do the punting for the Second?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I—I didn’t play much, you see.”</p>

<p>“Still, you might have kept in practice, Burtis,”
responded Mr. Dana with a slight frown.
“Why didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I did practice a good deal. I used to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
down here in the mornings between recitations for
a while.”</p>

<p>“That sounds more like the boy I used to
know,” said the other approvingly. “You used
to have as much stick-at-it as any lad I ever met.
Did you get so you could do your forty yards all
right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, and forty-five lots of times. I tried
dropping goals a good deal, though. I did seven
out of ten from the thirty-five yard line one
day.”</p>

<p>“That was from placement, of course. But
even then it—”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir, that was drop-kicking. I’ve made
placements from the forty, and once from the
forty-three.”</p>

<p>“What! Look here, Burtis, did anyone see you
do it?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, sir. I was alone.”</p>

<p>“And you mean to say that you can go out there
and make a place-kick from, say, the thirty-five
yards without trouble?”</p>

<p>Kendall looked doubtful. Mr. Dana’s earnestness
made him feel uneasy. “Why—why, I don’t
know, sir. I <em>could</em> do it, but I haven’t kicked
lately. I guess it would soon come back to me.”</p>

<p>“But—why, look here, Burtis! Aren’t you eligible
for the team?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose so, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then—then I’m blest if I understand it,”
muttered Mr. Dana. “Payson must be crazy!”
He looked around him. Then, he took a firm hold
on Kendall’s sleeve and pulled him to his feet.
“You come with me,” he commanded. Kendall,
wondering, followed. Mr. Dana reached down
and scooped up a football with one hand and
ducked under the rope. Kendall went after.
Curious glances followed them to the corner of
the stand, but in the next moment they were forgotten,
for the Yardley team came trotting out
onto the field and the Yardley cheer leaders scuttled
to their places and seized their big blue megaphones.</p>

<p>“Now, fellows! Regular cheer for the Team!
And everyone get into it. Ready! One! Two!
Thr—”</p>

<p>Then off bounced the discarded megaphones,
arms waved and the stand rocked with the burst
of sound that followed. Blue flags fluttered and
tossed against the rising bank of shouting youths
and down below the big drum <em>boom-boomed</em> an
accompaniment. Oh, Yardley wasn’t defeated yet,
nor disheartened! The game was still to be won!
So everybody into it! Make ’em hear you!
Louder! Cheer, you fellows up there! <em>Boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom!</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>“Give ’em the Can-Can, fellows!” shouted a
leader.</p>

<p>“<em>Who</em> can, can, can? <em>We</em> can, can, can! <em>Anybody</em>
can, can beat old Broadwood! <em>Who</em> can,
can, can? <em>We</em> can, can, can! <em>Anybody</em> can, can
beat old Broadwood!”</p>

<p>But Broadwood’s supporters were not idle.
The deep, booming cheers of the Green thundered
across from the opposite stand and it was not until
the whistle had blown and the ball was in the
air that comparative quiet fell.</p>

<p>Yardley had made one change in her line-up.
Jensen had replaced Stark at right tackle. Broadwood
held Yardley for two downs; took a penalty
for off-side play and wrested the ball away almost
in midfield. Then she began her real attack.
Reid and Rhodes, the heavy artillery, crashed
into and through the Blue line for short gains, and
Raynor, lighter and first cousin to a streak of
lightning, broke around tackle and past the wings
for yards at a time. Broadwood’s adherents
shouted themselves hoarse with joy. Down past
the thirty yards went the enemy, Yardley fighting
stubbornly and contesting every foot of ground
but yielding nevertheless. It was a terrific onslaught
and Those Who Knew on the Yardley side
looked grave. But down on the twenty-five the
defense grew firmer, the gains shorter. The secondary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
defense, playing close up, stopped what
leaked past the outer breastworks. A yard now;
then two; then—</p>

<p>“Third down; seven to go!” cried the umpire.</p>

<p>Yardley stood up to a man on the boards and
shouted imploringly: “<em>Hold</em> ’em! <em>Hold</em> ’em!
<em>Hold</em> ’em!” And from across the trampled field
came the frenzied cries of the enemy; “<em>Touchdown!
Touchdown! Touchdown!</em>”</p>

<p>Broadwood meant to try a forward pass, but the
ball went back badly, trickled away from the quarter
and was pounced on by Fogg. How Yardley
yelled when they saw the Green’s quarter trot up
the field with hanging head! Norton dropped
back as if to kick, but Dan, running behind the
line, took the ball at a toss from Simms and cut
through between tackle and end. He was clean
away before the play was solved, and then it was
up to Saunders, the Green’s quarter to prevent a
score. But near the forty-yard line Dan swung
sharply past him as he dived, shook off a detaining
hand and streaked straight down the field and
under the crossbar for a touchdown, a half-dozen
Broadwood pursuers trailing behind!</p>

<p>What a pandemonium broke loose then on the
Yardley stand! Caps flew into the air, the big
drum boomed, flags darted and snapped! Beyond
the rope two cheer leaders, clasped closely together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
danced and cavorted, and the Second Team
fellows were jumping around like maniacs. Near
at hand, Mr. Payson strolling along the line,
pulled his pipe from his pocket, filled it with
steady fingers and took his first smoke that day.
Even the fact that Hammel missed the goal failed
to leaven the joy.</p>

<p>But Broadwood wasn’t ready to acknowledge
defeat. Back she went as savagely as ever, but
Yardley seemed to have found herself now and,
while she couldn’t always stop the Green, she
made the going much more difficult. Broadwood
lost the ball presently on a fumble and Yardley
started back the way she had come. Simms was
holding nothing back now. Every play he knew
was called on. But the opponents were well
blessed with that football sense that enables a
team to “size up” a play even while it is getting
under way, and few of Payson’s pet tricks netted
real gains. It was elemental football that won
the most ground for Yardley, plays in which Roeder
or Hammel banged, smashed and wormed
themselves through the opposing line. Stearns,
too, found his holes and did his best. Forty-eight
yards went the Blue without a pause, just winning
their distance time and again by inches only.
Then came a mix-up of signals and Roeder was
thrown heavily three yards behind his line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>It took him a minute or two to get his breath
back and the Yardley supporters waited anxiously.
But presently he was up again, shaking his head
like a bulldog who has had the worst of a battle,
and a wild shout of joy hurtled across to him. A
forward pass, Simms to Norton, gained seven
yards, and the whistle blew for the end of the
quarter.</p>

<p>The ball was carried to the other end of the
field and in a minute or two later they were at it
again. It was Yardley’s ball on Broadwood’s
seventeen-yard line and nothing, it seemed, could
prevent a second score for the Blue. But something
did. Something turned a decisive victory
into a probable defeat. With four yards to go
on second down, Roeder fumbled. Simms fell on
the ball. It was third down and eight to go.
Roeder plunged straight at right tackle, the line
wavered and gave, cries and tumult filled the air.
The whistle blew. Somewhere at the bottom of a
pile of players lay the ball—and Tom Roeder.
When they found the former it lacked a foot of
being where it should have been for a first down,
and when they found Tom they turned him over
and held him quiet while the doctor ran onto the
field. It was a blow on the head, or possibly a
kick, and Tom was of no more use that day. He
was borne off between two substitutes, his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
lolling on his shoulder, the little doctor striding
along briskly behind, while a great cheer went up
for “<em>Roeder! Roeder! Roeder!</em>”</p>

<p>In sped Fayette to take his place. But Fortune
had dealt hardly with the Blue. She had lost her
best back and she had lost the ball on that play.
Broadwood got through for six yards on a fake
kick, gained two more around Norton’s end and
made her distance through Jensen. But on the
next play she was thrown back, and, as the ball
was still perilously close to her goal-line, Captain
Bishop dropped back and got off a wonderful
punt. Down went the Broadwood ends, with Dan
and Norton blocking them off. Dan disposed of
his man, Scott, right tackle, but Furniss got away
from Norton and by the time Simms was under
the ball Furniss was ready for Simms. Bishop,
meanwhile, had followed his kick very closely, and
when the ball descended into Simms’s arms Furniss
tackled savagely. The pigskin bounded
away. Dan and Bishop both made for it, but
Bishop was nearer. The Broadwood captain took
it on the bound, squirmed past Dan, and streaked
for the goal-line, thirty yards away. It was a
close race, and had the distance been forty yards
instead of thirty Dan would have brought down
his quarry. But as it was Bishop plunged over
the last white mark just before Dan’s arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
wrapped themselves about him, and the score was
tied!</p>

<p>It was Broadwood’s moment and she made the
most of it. She had no band to help her, but she
didn’t need it! And while the wild cheers were
still thundering out, the Yardley players drew up
in line under the crossbar, Simms with tears
streaming down his tired face, and Bishop himself
directed the canting of the ball held by Saunders.</p>

<p>A strange stillness settled over the field. If
Bishop kicked the goal—and it was not a difficult
one—it would probably spell a Broadwood victory,
for the last quarter was fully half over.
There were plenty of white faces on the Yardley
stand just then and more than one fellow, his
clenched hands thrust into his pockets, settled
back into his seat and refused to look.</p>

<p>Very leisurely, Bishop, still fighting for breath
after his run, directed Saunders. Finally he
stepped back, hitched his trousers at the waist,
cast a glance at the goal, and—kicked.</p>

<p>Up went the ball, straight for the bar. One
brief instant of suspense, and then—bedlam on
the Broadwood side and deep gloom across the
field! On the score board Broadwood’s 5 changed
to a 6.</p>

<p>“How much time?” cried Simms as the teams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
trotted back to their places. The timer held up
one outstretched hand and two fingers of the other.</p>

<p>“Seven minutes, Dan,” panted Simms.
“There’s time to kill ’em yet.”</p>

<p>“All right! Hard into it, fellows!” cried Dan.</p>

<p>Mr. Payson sent in Sayer for Norton and Plant
for Mitchell, and the game went on. Broadwood
resumed the defensive now. Yardley got the ball
as far as the Green’s thirty-eight yards only to
lose it on downs, and Broadwood promptly booted
the leather far up the field again. Simms got
away for a twenty-yard run once, and Fayette,
who, if he was not Roeder’s equal, was fresh and
untired and eager, pulled off a wonderful plunge
through the left of the Green’s line and squirmed
and pulled himself—and three opponents—along
for twelve yards! Hammel pounded the line for
gains and Stearns knifed himself through for a
yard or two at a time. Then came a fumble by
Fayette and a Broadwood player pounced on the
ball. Once more Broadwood kicked. Stearns
caught the punt on the run, the interference
formed about him, and he came pounding back for
nearly twenty yards.</p>

<p>Again Yardley took up the journey, but the time
was growing perilously short. Past the middle
of the field she worked; Hammel; Fayette;
Stearns; then Hammel again. Finally an end run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
by Simms that laid the pigskin on the thirty-five-yard
line. A plunge by Fayette netted a scant
yard and Stearns tried a skin-tackle play and
made six. But he was hurt and Greene took his
place. Broadwood seized the opportunity to put
three fresh men into her line. Greene was given
the ball on the next play and tore off three yards,
making it first down again. Only two minutes
and a half remained. Simms, hoarse, almost
staggering, called signals, changed them and then
looked appealingly at Dan.</p>

<p>“It’s all right!” yelled Dan savagely. “Go
ahead!”</p>

<p>But it wasn’t all right. Fayette should have
had the ball, and Fayette wasn’t there. Simms
was still clutching it when the Broadwood left
guard hurled himself through and slammed Simms
to earth. Simms gave up then for a minute.
Ryan came on with the pail and the big sponge,
and Dan and Ridge talked together while the
quarter struggled for his breath.</p>

<p>“We’d better have Holmes, hadn’t we?” asked
Ridge through two swollen lips.</p>

<p>Dan shook his head, looking doubtfully at the
side-line.</p>

<p>“No, Simms can do it if it can be done. Why,
oh, why, Hal, haven’t we a fellow who can kick
that ball over from here? I’d try it myself if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
there was a ghost of a chance. Even Norton’s off
now, and he’s about the only one—”</p>

<p>He broke off and hurried over to Simms. The
quarter was on his feet and staring rather dazedly
around him.</p>

<p>“What’s the down, Dan?” he whispered huskily.</p>

<p>“Second; twelve to gain. Come back here.”
He led him away. “What do you think? Forward
pass? Or Number 24? Or shall we try to
smash it out, Al?”</p>

<p>“Smashing’s—no good—now,” panted Simms.
“Roeder’s the only fellow—who could get us by.
Better try a forward, Dan; it’s the only chance.
Isn’t it? What else can we do, Dan? There’s
only a couple of minutes more, and it’s second
down. Gee, Dan, I don’t want to lose this game!”
Simms was almost whimpering now.</p>

<p>“Cut out the weeps,” said Dan brutally.
“Brace up, Al. Try a forward. Give it to me
and I’ll get through with it somehow!”</p>

<p>Simms dug a dirty knuckle into one eye, took a
long breath and said quietly: “All right, Cap.
We’ll get ’em yet!”</p>

<p>“Hurry up,” said the referee impatiently.</p>

<p>“You’ve got two minutes more,” cried the
timer, running up, watch in hand.</p>

<p>“All right here,” said Dan. “Now, fellows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
get into this and make it go! You’ve got to do it!
They’re half dead already! They can’t stop you!
They can’t stop you! Look at them! They’re
beaten now and they know it!”</p>

<p>“We’d be dead for sure if bluff counted,”
growled Bishop, as he edged along in front of
Dan.</p>

<p>The whistle blew.</p>

<p>Simms laid his hand on Fogg’s back and raised
his voice huskily: “Twenty-seven—twenty-one—fifteen—thirty-three—”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried Greene. “Here’s a sub coming!”</p>

<p>Simms straightened up again. Onto the field
raced a youth in a pair of long gray trousers and a
blue sweater.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” cried Dan impatiently.
Simms nodded.</p>

<p>“Substitute for right half, sir!” cried the newcomer.</p>

<p>“Who the dickens—” began Greene in disgust
as he tore off his headgear. Dan hurried back,
frowning.</p>

<p>“Here, who sent you on?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Payson.”</p>

<p>“Hurry up, please!” cried the referee.</p>

<p>But Dan and Simms and the newcomer were
whispering together and paid no heed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll penalize you for delay if you don’t start,”
threatened the referee.</p>

<p>“All right, fellows!” cried Dan, springing back
to his place, and,</p>

<p>“<em>Change signals!</em>” shouted Simms.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>KENDALL MAKES THE FIRST</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">As Mr. Dana, followed by Kendall, had gone
around the end of the stand the Yardley
players had come crowding past. Behind
them, talking to Dan, was Mr. Payson, and the
coach, observing the football in Mr. Dana’s hand,
had stopped a moment.</p>

<p>“You’ll be lame to-morrow if you do,” he said
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Not me,” replied Mr. Dana; “I know better.
I’m going to try to solve a mystery, Payson.”</p>

<p>The coach nodded and went on, and Mr. Dana
and Kendall skirted the back of the stand until
they reached the edge of the links. Then Mr.
Dana turned to Kendall.</p>

<p>“Now pull your coat and vest off, turn up your
trousers and show me, Burtis!”</p>

<p>“Kick it, sir?” asked Kendall wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Kick the stuffing out of it! See how near
you can come to putting it over there by that red
flag.”</p>

<p>Kendall threw aside coat and vest, took a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
reef in his precious gray trousers at the bottoms
and took the ball. “Drop-kick, sir?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Kendall poised the ball in his hands, judged
distance and direction, took a step, dropped the
pigskin and met it fairly with his toe. It was a
fairly good kick, the ball traveling some thirty-five
yards or more before it struck, but it landed
twenty or thirty feet away from the flag. He
turned apologetically to Mr. Dana.</p>

<p>“That wasn’t very good, but you see I haven’t
kicked for two or three weeks. Shall I try it
again?”</p>

<p>“Yes, try a placement.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dana led the way with long strides to where
the ball lay and picked it up. “I’ll hold it for
you,” he said. “Make it straight and goal-high,
Burtis. Suppose you were kicking from the
thirty yards.” Mr. Dana dropped his cane,
tossed his hat beside it and stretched himself out
on the turf. Then with the ball lengthwise between
his hands he waited directions.</p>

<p>“I—I never had anyone hold it for me,” said
Kendall dubiously. “Will you put it more that
way, please?”</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“All right, I guess.” Kendall stepped forward,
swung and the ball shot away, turning on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
its shortened axis, straight and true. Mr. Dana,
poised on one knee, watched. Had there been a
crossbar within thirty-five yards that ball would
have gone over it with room to spare. Mr. Dana
arose, brushed his knees and elbows lightly and
shook his head. Kendall saw and was humble.</p>

<p>“It’s awfully hard to judge, Mr. Dana, when
there aren’t any lines to go by. I’ll try again, if
you like.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dana eyed him thoughtfully. Finally,</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you frankly, Burtis, that your form is
miserable, but that’s something that can be easily
mended. If you swung freer from your hip, kept
your knee locked tightly, you’d get another ten
yards, I believe. But I’m not finding any fault,
my boy. I used to be a pretty good kicker in my
day, but I couldn’t have equaled that last one before
my freshman year in college. Let’s try a
couple more if you’re not tired.”</p>

<p>“I’m not tired at all,” Kendall answered, trying
to hide the pleasure he felt, “but I’m a little
stiff yet.”</p>

<p>“All right; we’ll get rid of some of that stiffness.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Mr. Dana, satisfied, told Kendall
to get his coat and vest. Then they
went back to the field. On the way Mr. Dana
said: “Burtis, I ought to apologize to you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
When you told me you’d done seven out of ten
from the thirty-five-yard line I—well, frankly, I
thought you were spreading it a bit thick. After
what you’ve shown me, though, I don’t doubt it.
The one thing I don’t understand is why Payson
hasn’t had you in training. Well, I wonder how
the fortunes of war are going. You go back to
your bench, Burtis, and have a rest. I want to
see Payson.”</p>

<p>He found the coach down opposite the play,
crouching low and pulling gently on a pipe that
had long since gone out. Broadwood had kicked
her goal and Yardley had the ball near the Green’s
forty yards. Mr. Payson looked up as the other
knelt beside him.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he said. “Have you noticed that
quarter-back of theirs, Dana? He’s going to
make the All-American some day if he keeps on
the way he’s started.”</p>

<p>“That so? I hadn’t noticed him especially.”
Yardley lost the ball on downs and Broadwood
punted. “Think we can do the trick, Payson?”</p>

<p>“I doubt it. Our fellows are getting pretty
tired. Watch this now. Simms has got it.”
The little quarter-back skirted the end and made
his twenty-yard gain, while the stand behind them
shrieked wildly. Then Fayette got through for
twelve, and the coach took his pipe from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
mouth, tapped the ashes out carefully and replaced
it between his teeth. Mr. Dana, watching
sympathetically, smiled. He knew pretty well
how the coach was feeling just then, for he had
been through it himself.</p>

<p>A minute or two later came Fayette’s fumble,
Broadwood’s punt and Stearns’s clever run after
the catch.</p>

<p>“Time must be getting short,” said Mr. Dana.
The coach nodded.</p>

<p>“I guess so. Not more than five or six minutes,
I suppose. A clean forward pass might help
now.”</p>

<p>But Simms was using his backs and Broadwood
was steadily losing ground. Then came Simms’s
run around the left end of the line and the ball
lay on the thirty-five yards. Seven more by
plunges, and time out for Stearns. Mr. Payson
looked, walked up the line and called “Greene!
Hurry up!” When the substitute ran up to him
he only said: “All right. Send Stearns out.
You know what to do. Tell Simms to plug away.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be a good idea to try a field
goal?” asked Mr. Dana. “There can’t be more
than a couple of minutes left.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t a man who could come within twenty
feet of the bar,” replied Mr. Payson shortly.</p>

<p>“Not out there you haven’t,” said Mr. Dana.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
“But there’s a chap back there on the bench who
could probably do it for you.”</p>

<p>Mr. Payson turned with a frown. “Who do
you mean?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Burtis, of the Second.”</p>

<p>“Never heard of him. Someone’s been stringing
you. Three fresh men for Broadwood, eh?”
He puffed hard at his empty pipe. The whistle
blew and the lines crouched again.</p>

<p>“No, I know what I’m talking about,” continued
Mr. Dana quietly. “He’s sort of a protégé
of mine. I’ve just had him back of the stand and
he made two or three drops and placements of
anywhere from thirty-five to forty-five, Payson.”</p>

<p>“What! Are you crazy, Dana?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>The coach took his eyes from the scrimmage
for one short moment. “Bring him here,” he
said curtly.</p>

<p>Mr. Dana hurried back to the center of the
field, his gaze searching the benches for Kendall.
But Kendall was not to be seen.</p>

<p>“I’m looking for Burtis,” he said anxiously
to some of the substitutes. “The coach wants
him.”</p>

<p>The fellows shook their heads. “Don’t know
him, sir. What’s he like?” asked one, eager to
assist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>“He was on the Second,” replied Mr. Dana impatiently.</p>

<p>The boy who had spoken hurried down to where
the Second Team men sat. “Any of you fellows
know who Burtis is?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Burtis! Yes, he was here a while ago.
Want him?”</p>

<p>“He went up into the stand about five minutes
ago,” volunteered another. He stood up and
turned toward the crowd beyond the rope. “Burtis!”
he bellowed at the top of his lungs. “Burtis
wanted!”</p>

<p>In the middle of the stand a boy arose uncertainly
and looked down. Mr. Dana saw him and
beckoned impatiently. And when Kendall had
wormed his way to the bottom he was over the
rope and was pulling him along.</p>

<p>“Payson wants you,” he said. “Here, pull off
that coat and vest. Who’s got a sweater to
loan?” Several of the substitutes jumped to
their feet.</p>

<p>“Take this, sir!”</p>

<p>“Thanks!” Mr. Dana selected one and tossed
it to Kendall. “Get into it,” he said quickly.
“Look after these things, somebody.” He tossed
Kendall’s beloved gray coat and vest helter-skelter
in the direction of the bench. “Come on,” he
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>Simms had just been buried under the big form
of the Broadwood left guard when they reached
Mr. Payson.</p>

<p>“Here’s your man, Payson,” announced Mr.
Dana.</p>

<p>The coach took his eyes from the inert form of
Simms for a moment and looked Kendall up and
down.</p>

<p>“Dana says you can kick,” he said inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, some.”</p>

<p>“Were you on the Second?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, for awhile.”</p>

<p>“Think you could go in there now and put that
ball over the goal for us?”</p>

<p>Kendall looked and shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t believe so, sir,” he faltered.</p>

<p>Mr. Payson shrugged his shoulders and
glanced at Mr. Dana.</p>

<p>“Thought so,” he said.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” said Mr. Dana as the coach
turned his attention to the field again. “What
do you mean, Kendall?” he asked sternly. “The
ball’s on the twenty-eight yards. That’s not a
hard kick.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, only I—I’ve never tried to kick in a
real game, and—”</p>

<p>“You’re afraid!” sneered Mr. Dana. “I
thought you had some spunk!” Kendall colored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
and stared miserably before him. “Do you mean
that you’d rather see Broadwood win than
go out there and try to make an easy goal like
that!”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied Kendall. “I’ll try.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dana looked at the coach. Mr. Payson
hesitated for a moment. Then he took his
pipe from his month and dropped it into his
pocket.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said. “Go in there, send
Greene out and tell Simms I say you’re to kick a
goal. And you <em>do</em> it, do you hear?”</p>

<p>“I’ll try, sir,” replied Kendall.</p>

<p>“Report to the referee first, Burtis,” said Mr.
Dana, clapping him on the back. “And just forget
that there’s anyone near you. Make believe
you’re kicking just to show me what you can do,
my boy. Never mind what’s ahead of you.
Watch the ball and boost it a good one!”</p>

<p>And Kendall, very frightened, ran onto the
field.</p>

<p>“<em>Change signals!</em>” cried Simms. “<em>Kick formation!</em>”</p>

<p>Kendall stepped back slowly, measuring the
distance, and dug his heel in the turf. Simms
scuttled back and dropped to the ground.</p>

<p>“Hold hard now!” cried Dan.</p>

<p>There was a great silence. The stands held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
their breath and even the players settled into
quiet. Only the sound of their labored breathing
came to Kendall as he dropped further back.</p>

<p>“Thirty-one! Sixty-four!” cried Simms.
“Seventeen! Eight—”</p>

<p>Back came the ball to his hands. He turned it
end up, canted it a trifle, settled it to earth. Kendall
stepped forward. He had forgotten that the
enemy, desperate and determined, were waiting
to throw themselves upon him. He only saw the
ball and, dimly, the whitewashed posts straight
ahead. The lines broke. Broadwood came rushing
through. Canvas rasped against canvas. Inarticulate
cries filled the air. Kendall’s toe met
the ball squarely below the lacing. Somebody
plunged against him and he went over backward.</p>

<p><a href="#i_frontis">But the ball went true</a>, safe over the upstretched
hands of the leaping Broadwood forwards,
<a href="#i_frontis">straight up and up</a>, turning leisurely in its
flight, <a href="#i_frontis">over the crossbar</a>!</p>

<p>Later, when Kendall, somewhat dazed, sat
again on the bench with a dozen fellows questioning
and laughing about him, the game
paused a moment and Arthur Thompson, throwing
off his blanket and sweater, limped onto the
field to play the final thirty seconds and win
his Y.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>And then it was all over, and Yardley, triumphant,
dizzy with joy, cavorted over the battleground
and tossed hats and caps over the crossbars,
while the Greenburg Band thumped out a
brazen march of victory!</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
